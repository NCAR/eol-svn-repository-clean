These scripts were written by Christian Sibo:

stmConverter.sh - Finds all the CEOP soils (.stm) data files and converts them to 
   netCDF files.  Also, runs the conversions from the netCDF format to the original 
   CEOP soils ASCII format.

stmDiff.sh - Finds the differences between the original CEOP soils ASCII files and the 
   CEOP soils ASCII files created from the netCDF format.
