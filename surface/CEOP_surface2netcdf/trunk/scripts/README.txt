These scripts were written by Christian Sibo:

sfcConverter.sh - Finds all the CEOP surface (.sfc) data files and converts them to 
   netCDF files.  Also, runs the conversions from the netCDF format to the original 
   CEOP surface ASCII format.

sfcDiff.sh - Finds the differences between the original CEOP surface ASCII files and the 
   CEOP surface ASCII files created from the netCDF format.
