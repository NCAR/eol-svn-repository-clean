<h3>  X.X.X Weather Station on Wheels (WOW)</h3>

<p>This data set contains surface meteorological data from the Weather Station on Wheels (WOW), an instrumented car deployed during the T-REX project.  WOW measured horizontal wind direction and speed, pressure, temperature and dew point, radiation and position while driving along different road legs in Owens Valley.  There is one mobile WOW station include in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.  The WOW station was not included in the Horizontal Quality Control process because it is a mobile station.</p>
<p>The WOW collection data every 1 second.  The five minute record for teh T-REX Five Minute Surface Composite is the nearest record to the nominal five minute record up to 10 seconds before the nominal time followed by up to 5 seconds after the nominal time.</p>
