# Created to sort QCF data so that it can be divided into day
# files using create_day_files
#
# Run this sort input file by typing: cosort  qcf_sort_spec
#
# If input is large, consider running cosort as back ground task &/or at
# a lower priority.
#
# Also you must sometimes indicate where you would like the cosort utility to
# work by setting the environment variable such as indicated below. Please 
# refer to the cosort documentation book for more on the cosort tuner.
