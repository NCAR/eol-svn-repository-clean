To Generate a MADIS station list:

1) make_MADIS_stnlist.pl

Run make_MADIS_stnlist.pl to generate date.out files which contain all stations in the raw netCDF files, and their location.  By default files are downloaded to the "raw/" subdir. Output files are written to the "out/" subdir.

	Usage: ./make_MADIS_stnlist.pl [-d] year month day
	-d: download files from HPSS
	    leave off if files are already downloaded

Check that you found the same number of stations that the MADIS web pages say we should have.

Note that code will append to output files, so if you want to start fresh, delete them before run code.

The code will also print out two files: date.precipAccum.freq and date.temperature.freq which show the frequency (in seconds) with which each station reported precip and temperature, respectively. e.g. blocks of:

NETWORK STN LAT LON ALT
freq(s) count
freq(s) count
