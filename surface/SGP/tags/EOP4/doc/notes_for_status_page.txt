Description of System Configuration and Measurement Methods
The meteorological observations made with the EBBR system are: 

Air temperature at two heights (1 m separation)
Relative humidity at two heights (1 m separation)
Net radiation (at 2 m typical)
Soil moisture at 2.5 cm depth
Soil heat flow at 5 cm depth
Soil temperature, integrated 0 to 5 cm
Barometric pressure
Wind direction at 2.5 m
Wind speed at 2.5 m
Reference temperature of control box 

...

Heights of individual sensors are listed in Primary Quantities Measured with System. Heights of air temperature and relative humidity sensors vary from site to site and are dependent on vegetation height; these heights can vary seasonally as vegetation height changes.
