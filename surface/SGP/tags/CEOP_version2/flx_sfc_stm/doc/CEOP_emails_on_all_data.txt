Subject: CEOP CPPA ARM SGP FLX 2005-2009 data ready for conversion

Don/Linda,

The CEOP CPPA ARM SGP FLX data for 2005-2009 are in-house and ready
for conversion.

This data set is comprised of EBBR and ECOR data:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/EBBR
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/ECOR

The DQR-based flags are:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/EBBR/flagging/SGP_EBBR_flagging_2005_2009.txt
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/ECOR/flagging/SGP_ECOR_flagging_2005_2009.txt

Several items to note here.

The 2003-2004 ARM SGP data had GAPP as the RHP (CSE).  For the data from
2005 on that should be CPPA instead.

You will note that some stations do not continue through the end of
2009.  These stations have been decommissioned and there will be no
further data from them.

The EBBR data changed parameter names starting 1 Jan 2009.  They are
much more sensible(!) names now.  The parameters we should be using are:

latent_heat_flux in place of e
sensible_heat_flux in place of h
surface_soil_heat_flux_avg in place of g1
corr_soil_heat_flow_1 in place of c_shf1

The parameter names for ECOR data remain the same throughout.

For the ECOR data at station E21 the times are incorrect (DST rather
than UTC) from 01/20/2009 at 2030 to 01/22/2009 at 1800.  Go ahead and
add 5 hours to the times in this period to correct this problem.

When it comes to checking and plotting these will need to be combined
with the archived data:
/export/archive/data/ceop/eop3and4/GAPP/SGP/GAPP_SGP_20021001_20041231.flx

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Scot

Don/Linda,

The CEOP CPPA ARM SGP STM data for 2005-2009 are in-house and ready
for conversion.

This data set is comprised of SWATS data:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SWATS

The DQR-based flags are:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SWATS/flagging/SGP_SWATS_flagging_2005_2009.txt

When it comes to checking and plotting these will need to be combined
with the archived data:
/export/archive/data/ceop/eop3and4/GAPP/SGP/GAPP_SGP_20021001_20041231.stm

Note that the earlier data had GAPP as the RHP (CSE).  For the new data
that should be CPPA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Scot

Subject: CEOP CPPA ARM SGP SFC 2005-2009 data ready for conversion

Linda/Don,

The CEOP CPPA ARM SGP SFC data for 2005-2009 are in-house and ready
for conversion.

This data set is comprised of SMOS, SIRS, IRT, and MET data:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SMOS
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/MET
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SIRS
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/IRT

The DQR-based flags are:
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SIRS/flagging/SGP_SIRS_flagging_2005_2009.txt
/ingest/CEOP/v2/ARM/SGP/SMOS/flagging/SGP_SMOS_flagging_2005_2009.txt

There are no DQR flags for the IRT or MET data sets.

Note that SMOS is replaced by MET as of 1 Oct 2009.  Also, some stations
start dropping out during the latter portion of 2009.

Here are the parameters to grab from MET:
atmos_pressure
temp_mean
rh_mean
wspd_vec_mean
wdir_vec_mean
tbrg_precip_total_corr

We need to apply the following corrections to SIRS:
E27 from 1649 on 05/20/2009 to 2005 on 06/03/2009
up_short_hemisp(new) = up_short_hemisp(old) * 116.66/111.85
down_short_hemisp(new) = down_short_hemisp(old) * 128.92 / 104.15

When it comes to checking and plotting these will need to be combined
with the archived data:
/export/archive/data/ceop/eop3and4/GAPP/SGP/GAPP_SGP_20021001_20041231.sfc

Note that the earlier data had GAPP as the RHP (CSE).  For the new data
that should be CPPA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Scot
