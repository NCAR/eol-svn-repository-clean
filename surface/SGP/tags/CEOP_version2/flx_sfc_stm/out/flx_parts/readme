The 2005-2008 flux was processed separately from the
2009 flux. The two outputs were then catted together
to make the 2005-2009 out file. This file was divided
by station into separate files, and then the E21
file was hand edited to fix a time shift from DST 
to UTC, per Scot's instructions:

"For the ECOR data at station E21 the times are incorrect (DST rather
than UTC) from 01/20/2009 at 2030 to 01/22/2009 at 1800. Go ahead and
add 5 hours to the times in this period to correct this problem."

A five hour period of missing obs at the end of the time shift 
was copied to the beginning of the period, and then the times
were changed to add 5 hours to them.
