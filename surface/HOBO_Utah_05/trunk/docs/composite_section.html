<h3>  X.X.X University of Utah HOBO</h3>
<p>This data set contains temperature data from the University of Utah HOBO stations located on (a) a West-East line running through Independence, California from the Sierras to the Inyos, (b) a West-East line running through Manzanar, California from the Sierras to the valley center, and (c) on a South-North line running from Lone Pine, California through Bishop, CA.  There are 49 HOBO stations included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>
<p>The sites for the temperature data loggers, also called HOBOs, are named by a one-letter prefix followed by a 2-digit number. This is optionally followed by a letter U. The sites are numbered consecutively from low elevations to higher elevations. On line (a) the HOBOs running westward up the Sierras from the Owens Valley floor are given the prefix W for West, on line (b) the hobos running up the east sidewall into the Inyo Mountains are given the naming prefix E for East. The HOBOs on line (c) are given the prefix M for Manzanar, while the HOBOs running up the valley floor from Lone Pine to Bishop are given the prefix V for Valley_floor. The HOBO temperature sensors were generally exposed in Gill-type 6-plate radiation shields, with the HOBO-radiation shield assembly bolted to fence posts so that the temperature sensors were generally 1 m above the ground. There was some variation in this height.</p>
<p>Seven of the sites on the valley floor had radiation shields that differed from the Gill-type shields mentioned above. These sites (V05U and V06-V11) used the 8-plate solar radiation shields that Onset Computer sells for the HOBOs. We do not anticipate that the type of radiation shield will be an important factor in the reported temperatures, as the radiation shields are both of the "self-aspirated" type and are comparable in design and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Instrumentation</b></p>
<p>The data logger is the HOBO H8 Pro Temp/Ext Temp data logger sold by Onset Computer of Bourne, Massachusetts (see URL below). This data logger is designed for outdoor use and is described in detail by Onset's commercial literature. The temperature data logger was tested for meteorological usage by Whiteman et al. (2003). Specifications and characteristics of the data logger are provided in that article. The data logger is attached to a Gill-type 6-plate radiation shield sold by the RM Young Co. (and by Campbell Scientific). The data logger is attached to the underside of the 6-plate shield with the temperature sensor itself exposed inside the shield. The radiation shield was attached to vertically-standing T-type steel fence posts that were pounded into the ground about 6 inches. The temperature sensors were nominally 1 m above ground. The effectiveness of the unaspirated radiation shields is described in papers referenced by Whiteman et al. (2000).</p>

<p><b>Data Remarks</b></p>
<p>Sites W03 and V04 were knocked over by cows sometime during the deployment. The user should check data from these sites to determine when this happened and how it affected the data. Other sites (M03, M13, and W04) were disturbed slightly by cows rubbing against the fence posts and tilting the radiation shields upward (but not knocking them down). Data from these "disturbed" sites are probably OK without modification.</p>
