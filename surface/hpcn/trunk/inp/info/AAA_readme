From conversations with Matt Warner at HPCN
at (1-402-972-9899 and ftp 129.93.221.65):

The data are hourly values running from 0100
to 2400 local standard time. None of the 
stations convert over to Daylight Savings
Time.

Missing data is flagged with 'M' (or 'm') char.
Estimated data is flagged with 'E' or 'e'.
See precip data for examples.

The VORTEX file contains lat/lon and other
data which we probably don`t need. Matt is
sending a hard copy of lat/lons/elev, etc
to me on 22 Dec 93.   VORTEX file has been
renamed to AAA_HPCN_stn_info.

There are 74 stations, each with a unique
number. When a stn closes, that number is
retired. Each stn number is preceed with
two letter state id, but not needed since
numbering system is unique.

Verify that lat/lon info is same as for
stormfest.

All stations are on local standard time
except the North Dakota stations. The ND
stations have had their times converted 
to Central, even if they were in Mountain
time.  The hplains.stns file has been
adjusted so that these times will be 
properly handled.
