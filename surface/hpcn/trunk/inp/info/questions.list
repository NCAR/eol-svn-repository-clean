Questions for 1995 High Plains Data.

1)  We have hard copy for station A211899 Crookston, MN but no data file 
to match.

2) We have a data file ne18.ucr which is an exact duplicate of co18.ucr 
(Akron, CO).  There is no corresponding hard copy sheet.  Can I delete ne18?

3) Most files have >Air Temp< in >F@4.9ft< but a few files only have 
>Sam Temp< in >F<.  Are these fields really equivalent?

4) Files with >Sam Temp< also have the units for >REL HUM< as >%-S< where 
all other files have the units for >REL HUM< simply as >%<.  Are these 
equivalent?

5) One field that we expect is >WIND DIR< in >DEGREES<.  Unfortunately 
no data files contain this field.  However most contain a field called 
>VECT DIR< and a few files have >DIRECTIN AV.<  Are >VECT DIR< and 
>DIRECTIN AV.< the same thing and are they the >WIND DIR< that we want?

6) We expect a field for >SOIL TMP< in >F< for each data file.  Most files 
have a field >Soil Tmp< in >F@4in< which is what I think we want to use.  
A few files have >Sam Soil T< in >F@4in<.  Are these equivalent?  A few 
files have more than one Soil Tmp field.  Sometimes the units are >F@2in< 
or >F@8in<, but in one case there are 2 fields labeled >Soil Tmp< >F@4in<.  
I think the second one may be mislabeled since the actual numbers are not 
the same and another file is identical except that the units are >F@8in< 
for 2nd one.  Can we always use the first >Soil Tmp< field and ignore any 
other Soil Tmp fields?

7) We expect a field >SOLAR< in >W/M**2<.  None of data files have anything 
in >W/M**2<.  Option 1 - set this field to missing since we really don't 
use it anyway.  Option 2 - most files have a >Rad Flux< in >Kcal m-2< 
which could maybe be converted?

8) Stratton vs. Sterling CO.  An old station list has Stratton at 39 18 lat, 
102 31 lon, 1390 ele. and Sterling at 40 28 lat, 103 01 lon, 1200 ele.  
The new hard copy shows Stratton at 40 28 lat, 103 01 lon, 1390 ele. and 
Sterling at 39 18 lat, 102 31 lon, 1200 ele.  The id numbers and names 
in the data files match those found on the hard copy, but Stratton should 
be south of Sterling.  What is really correct?
