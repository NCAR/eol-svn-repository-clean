<h3>Quality-Controlled Data, February 12, 2007</h3>

Access to this data set is restricted to TREX principle investigators.
Contact <a href="/homes/oncley">Steve Oncley</a> for a username

These 5-minute average statistics have been derived
from the TREX/ISFF merged dataset, in which the locally-stored data 
from the 3 stations has been merged to fill in gaps in the data
that were collected through the wireless network.
All of the processing steps described in the 
<A HREF="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/projects/trex/isff">
TREX/ISFF WWW page</A> have
been applied.  Obviously bad data have been removed.  Calibrations have
been changed as appropriate.  All known corrections to data have been applied.
Note that longer-term averages are straightforward to derive from
these 5-minute values.  See the ISFF document 
<a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rtf/facilities/isff/cov_calc.pdf">
"Combining short-term moments for longer time periods"</a>.
<p>

Note that these data no longer have "stations=0", which some ISFF
users are used to.  All variables have a "station" dimension (3
columns) even when values only exist at one site.  For example,
Rlw.in.10m (from one of the extra radiometers at central) has data
only in column 1 and N10 (from the aerosal counter at west) has data
only in column 3.  The ASCII Java applet also will show data being
available from the other 2 stations.<P>

Access to the high-rate (individual sample) time series currently are
available only using EOL computers.  (This may change in the future.)
Again, contact Steve Oncley for access to these data.  Note that, for
the first time for ISFF, most of the corrections are available on
the high-rate data as well.  The only exception is the correction of
soil data from central. <P>
