<p>
         The Integrated Surface Flux Facility (ISFF) is designed to study 
     exchange processes between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. This 
     includes the direct measurement of fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent 
     heat, trace gases, and radiation as well as standard atmospheric and 
     surface variables. Only surface variables are included in this T-REX 
     5-minute surface composite. There are 3 ISFF stations included in this
     T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.

<p>The Calculated Sea Level Pressure was computed from station pressure, temperature, dew point, and station elevation using the formula of <a href="">Wallace and Hobbs (1977)</a>.</p>
<p>The dew point was computed from the temperature and relative humidity using the formula from <a href="">Bolton (1980)</a>.</p>
<p><b>Instrumentation</b></p>
<p>

         Measurements from the following instrumentation are included in this 
     T-REX 5-minute surface composite.
<pre>
    * Sonic anemometers (all Campbell CSAT3) at 10m.
    * T/RH sensors at 5m.
    * Vaisala PTB220B, barometer at 1m, with a single-disk static pressure port at 5m.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
         Wind speed and direction were calculated from U and V wind components.  Dewpoint and calculated sea level pressure were calculated by NCAR/EOL.  For information on the calculation of parameters derived by NCAR/EOL from the raw parameters available, see <a href="#Section%202.2">Section 2.2</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Algorithms and Sensor Notes</b></p>
<p>
         Following are notes on the deployment, operation, and post-project 
     processing of data from each of the sensors.  All deployment, operation,
     and post-project processing described in this section were performed by
     NCAR/EOL/ISFF. For information on the calculation of parameters derived by 
     NCAR/EOL from the raw parameters available, see <a href="#Section 2.2">
     Section 2.2</a>.  See <a href="#Section 3.0">Section 3.0</a> for the 
     quality control processing performed by NCAR/EOL on the composite dataset
     which contains this data.
</p>
<p>  Sonic Anemometer</p>
<p>
     CSAT3s were used at all sites. No problems were noted with these during the experiment. Data glitches that were caught by the sensor despiking algorithm appear always to be related to recent rain. The archived data appear to be good.
</p>
<p>
     All sonics reported at 60sps.
</p>
<p>
     The boom angles have been applied to the data, so winds are now in geographic coordinates (+u = wind blowing to East; +v = wind blowing to North; +w = upward). The tilt corrections have not been applied, to keep data from all towers in a similar reference frame (gravitational vertical). Note that fluxes from West (with tilt angles of ~4 degrees) will require some thought to interpret.
</p>

<p>  Rain Gauge</p>
<p>
     There are no data before April 6th, 2006, due to the rain gauge cable being connected to the wrong channel on the datalogger. Presumed rain dates judged from zero voltage readings from the krypton hygrometer as water moisture readings are as follows:
<pre>
    March 20th, 2006: ~17:00-00:00 (intermittent rain occured at all sites)
    April 3rd, 2006, ~13:00 - April 4th, 2006, ~11:00 (intermittent rain occured only at west site only)
    April 4th, 2006, ~15:00 - April 5th, 2006, ~1:00 (intermittent rain occured at all sites)
</pre>
