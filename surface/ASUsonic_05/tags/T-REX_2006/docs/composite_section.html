<h3>  X.X.X Arizona State University (ASU) Environmental Fluid Dynamics Group Flux Tower Sonics</h3>

<p>This data set contains surface meteorological data from the Arizona State University (ASU) Environmental Fluid Dynamics Group Sonics Flux Tower placed in Independence, CA for the T-REX project.  There is one ASU sonics station included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>
<p>The ASU Sonics Flux Tower collected data every 0.1 second. The five minute record for the T-REX 5-minute surface composite is an average of a minimum of 200 non-missing 0.1 second records that were recorded during the prior minute to the five minute record.</p>
<p><span style="color: red">CHECK ON THIS (May want to remove related instruments as well)</span>  The pressure and dew point measurements were not included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>

<!--
<p>The Calculated Sea Level Pressure was computed from station pressure, temperature, dew point, and station elevation using the formula of <a href="">Wallace and Hobbs (1977)</a>.</p>
<p>The dew point was computed from the temperature and relative humidity using the formula from <a href="">Bolton (1980)</a>.</p>
