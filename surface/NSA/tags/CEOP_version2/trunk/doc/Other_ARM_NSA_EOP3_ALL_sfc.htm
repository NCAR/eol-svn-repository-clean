1.0  DATA SET OVERVIEW


This data set contains 30-minute resolution surface meteorological and
radiation data from the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Reference 
Site operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program at its 
North Slope of Alaska (NSA) facility in Alaska.  This data set 
includes observations from two locations.  This data set covers the 
time period 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003.  Further information 
about the ARM NSA site is available at the 
following URL: <a href="http://www.arm.gov">http://www.arm.gov</a>

1.1  Station Locations

Site                Elev (m)  Latitude  Longitude
-------------------------------------------------
Barrow, AK     C1     8.0     71.323 N  156.609 W
Atqasuk, AK    C2    20.0     70.4718N  157.4066W

Both stations have observations of air temperature, relative humidity,
dew point, specific humidity, wind speed, wind direction, U wind 
component, V wind component, station pressure, precipitation, skin
temperature, incoming longwave, incoming shortwave, outgoing longwave,
outgoing shortwave and net radiation.

The C2 station also provides observations of snow depth.

Neither station provides observations of incoming or outgoing PAR.


2.0  INSTRUMENTATION DESCRIPTION

The ARM NSA meteorological tower measurements at the Barrow site are 
from their Barrow Meteorology (BMET) tower.  At the Atqasuk site the 
meteorological tower measurements are from their 10-m tower.

2.1  BMET Sensors (Barrow site)

Full descriptions of the instruments used at the Barrow site are
available in the file ARM_NSA_BMET.stm.html included as part of the data set.
They are also available on the web at:
http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/bmet.stm

2.2  SMET (Atqasuk) Sensors

Thermometer
	Temperature, 2m and 6m level on tip tower, Vaisala HMP35D
        PRTD (Platinum resistance thermal detector)
Humicap
	Humidity, 2m and 6m level on tip tower, Vaisala model HMP45D 	 
Barometer, digital
	Pressure, Vaisala model PTB201A 	 


3.0  DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING


3.1  ARM Data Collection and Processing

Information on ARM Processing can be found at the instrument
web pages:

Barrow Meteorology: http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/bmet.stm
SMET: No web page

3.2  UCAR/JOSS Data Processing

The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Offfice for
Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) converted the data from the raw format
provided by ARM into the CEOP EOP-3 data format agreed to by
the CEOP Scientific Steering Committee.  This format is described
in detail as part of the CEOP Reference Site Data Set Procedures
Report which is available at the following URL:
<a href="http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/refdata_report/ceop_met_tower_format.html">
http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/refdata_report/ceop_met_tower_format.html</a>


4.0  QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES


4.1  ARM Quality Control Procedures

For futher information on ARM QC Procudures see the instrument
web pages:

Barrow Meteorology: http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/bmet.stm
SMET: No web page

4.2  UCAR/JOSS Quality Control Procedures

UCAR/JOSS converted the ARM QC flags into the CEOP QC flags in the 
following manner.  If a parameter failed one of the ARM QC checks it was 
flagged as Questionable/Dubious ("D") and if it failed two or more ARM 
QC checks it was flagged as Bad ("B").

Additionally, UCAR/JOSS conducted two primary quality assurrance/control
procedures on the reference site data.  First the data has 
been evaluated by a detailed QA algorithm that verifies the format is 
correct, examines any QC flags, and conducts basic checks on data 
values.  Second, JOSS conducts a manual inspection of time series 
plots of each parameter.


5.0  GAP FILLING PROCEDURES


No gap filling procedures were applied to these data by either
ARM or UCAR/JOSS.


6.0  DATA REMARKS


6.1 ARM Data Quality Report for station C2 (Atqasuk) All Parameters

Missing data from 0029 UTC on 22 September 2002 to 1935 UTC on
21 November 2002:

Due to unknown wiring differences and pin changes by Vaisala to their
Wind Speed and Direction sensors, a power feedback into the QLI data
collector occurred.  This caused an overload which shut the QLI data
collector down.  Once trouble shooting pinpointed the power feedback,
wiring diagrams were created and the differences were found.  Wiring
was changed to prevent and remove the power feedback.

6.2 ARM Data Quality Report for station C2 (Atqasuk) All parameters

From 1430 UTC on 25 November 2002 to 2229 UTC on 26 March 2003:

Missing met, present weather, and snow depth data due to comm error

An error in the communication sub-routine of the Bridgeview collection
software occurred resulting in data loss from the Snow Depth sensor,
Present Weather Sensor and the Barometer.
