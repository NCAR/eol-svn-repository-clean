2.0 General Description
    
This data set contains the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP)
Enhanced Observing Period 1 (EOP-1) Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
(GEWEX) North Slope Alaska (NSA) Hourly Surface Meteorology, Flux, and
Radiation Data Set. This data set contains hourly data from two stations for
the CEOP EOP-1 time period (01 July 2001 to 30 September 2001). The University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support
(UCAR/JOSS) did not perform quality control processing on this data set.

3.0  Detailed Data Description

This data set is also available on-line in 30-minute native format at
<a href="http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/">http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/</a> under the link "CEOP EOP-1 Reference
Site Data Sets"

3.1 NSA Algorithms

This hourly data set was formed by extracting the top of the hour observations
from the native format data. The U and V wind components were computed from
wind speed and direction.

More information regarding this site can be found under the <a href="http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/rsite.html">CEOP Reference
Site Station Characteristics</a> link on the UCAR/JOSS CEOP Data Management page
at http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ghp/ceopdm/.

More information on the ARM algorithms used to process the native format data
can be found at <a href="http://www.arm.gov/docs/sites/nsa/nsaaao.html">www.arm.gov/docs/sites/nsa/nsaaao.html</a>.

3.2 Station Information

The following is a complete description of the station information provided
with this CEOP NSA data set. Table 1 details the station list parameters. NSA
values for each parameter are listed in brackets at the end of each line. The
beginning and ending dates for the period of coverage are in Universal Time
Coordinated (UTC). The Identification Type field is network dependent and
indicates the source of the Identification field. The Occurrence field is an
integer value used to indicate co-located stations. Note that when a
particular parameter is unknown for a station, either a blank, a question
mark, or all 9's will appear in that parameter's position. For a complete list
of Country, State, and County values, refer to the document in the references
(Section 5.0). Possible platform types and frequency values are listed in
Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Note that only those platform types present in
the CEOP EOP-1 data have been listed.

3.3  Detailed Format Description
     
The CEOP EOP-1 NSA Hourly Surface Meteorology, Flux, and Radiation Data Set
contains 10 metadata parameters and 22 data parameters. The metadata
parameters describe the station location and time at which the data were
collected. The time of observation is reported both in Universal Time
Coordinated (UTC) Nominal and UTC actual time. Days begin at UTC 0100 and end
at UTC 0000 the following day. Note that missing parameter values are
indicated by "-999.99".  The table below x details the data parameters in each
record.
