<p>This data set contains surface meteorological data from the Desert Research Institute (DRI) automatic weather stations around Owens Valley in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in eastern California.  There are 16 stations included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>
<p>The DRI AWS reported data every 30 seconds.  The five minute records for the T-REX 2006 5-minute composite are the records that occured on the five minute interval.</p>
<p>The Calculated Sea Level Pressure was computed from station pressure, temperature, dew point, and station elevation using the formula of <a href="">Wallace and Hobbs (1977)</a>.</p>
<p>The dew point was computed from the temperature and relative humidity using the formula from <a href="">Bolton (1980)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Instrumentation</b></p>
<p>The individual automatic weather stations have been built with the Campbell Scientific instrumentation (CSI; <a href="http://www.campbellscientific.com">www.campbellscientific.com</a>). Each station has a 10-meter tower with sensors for pressure, temperature, relative humidity and wind mounted directly on the tower or on arms attached to the tower. The sensors are sampled every 3 seconds, and the data is temporally averaged over 30-second non-overlapping intervals. A radio telemetry system connects individual stations to the base station located in Independence, CA to allow remote transmission of temporally averaged data to the central repository at DRI. The radio communication is through 900 MHz spread spectrum wireless radios, manufactured by Freewave.</p>

<p>The network was constructed and is operated in collaboration with Western Regional Climate Center at DRI (<a href="http://www.wrcc.dri.edu">www.wrcc.dri.edu</a>). The network has been in continuous operation since late February 2004.</p>

<p><b>Sensors</b></p>
<ol>
   <li><p>Air Temperature and Relative Humidity</p>
       <p>Air temperature and relative humidity sensors are Vaisala HMP45C-L. The two separate sensors are packaged in the same sensor housing mounted two meters above the ground.</p>
       </li>
   <li><p>Wind</p>
       <p>Wind is measured by 05103-L Wind Monitor, which has a propeller-type anemometer and a wind vane with fuselage and tail, manufactured by RM Young. It is mounted at the top of the tower, 10 meter above the ground.</p>
       </li>
   <li><p>Pressure</p>
       <p>Air pressure is measured by Vaisala PTB210 digital barometer (www.vaisala.com) using Vaisala BAROCAP Sensor, a silicon capacitive absolute pressure sensor. The sensors and the attached static pressure heads are mounted two meters above the ground.</p>
       </li>
</ol>

<p>All sensors are field calibrated by the Western Region Climate Center once a year. The last calibration was in mid-February 2006, close to the start of the T-REX campaign.</p>
