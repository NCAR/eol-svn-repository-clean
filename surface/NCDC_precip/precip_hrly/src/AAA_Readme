The following code/scripts are used to
convert from E-Bufr to pqcf format:

process_precip.c, ep2pq.f


The following code/scripts are used to
perform qc steps:

pqc.c - main qc program - gross limit checks,

pqcf_sort - formerly known as pqcf.specs -
          this cosort spec sorts data by lat/lon
          then time for accum program (jac2.c).

jac2.c    - Check accumulation data and ensure
          complete.

(See 15min programs below which would 
 execute here.)

ebdayfs.sc - script to divide data into days.
        runsplt.in is the input file.

-----------

snm.c  - puts in network and station names - not 
     yet used. Want to use Dave Rollins new
     c++ based program to access updated/correct
     database values.

p2e.f - converts pqcf to Ebufr format.

---------15 min programs---------

pck.c - Writes a list of potential hrly stns
        that show up in 15 min data. These
        stns should be removed. Use jac.c or
        sck.c to remove hrly stns from 15min
        file. This only applies to 15min data
        not hrly ncdc data. Note that the
        jac and sck program modify the 15min
        data by pushing the times up 15mins.
        This was just something they found had
        to be done.
