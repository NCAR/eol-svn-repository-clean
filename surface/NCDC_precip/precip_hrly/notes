Ran NCDC process_precip on April data in two different ways.
	1) Selected all of April into one file
	2) Selected each day of April into different files

Results:
	- "all.*" files are the same  (these are combined from all "*.dat" files)
	- the station.list formed from the month select has some garbage
		(see /out/final/stlst.dif)
	- the log file for the month select has a long series of dropped lat/lon
	    the day select does not have these dropped lat/lon
	    (see apr.log and apr2.log in /exe)
	- the IDs which did not match and were dropped were the same in both the 
	  month and the day select
	- checkers check_PQCF_comp and statPQCF came out with same results on
	  on both sets of data

Note:  also tried a select from April 1 to May 10.
       Had errors with snm, according to log file.
