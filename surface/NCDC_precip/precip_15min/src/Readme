The source code that performs the
conversion and the QC for precip
handles both hourly and 15min precip
data. Since the hourly precip was
performed first, all source code
which applies to both hourly and 15min
is located in /precip_hrly/src.
To prevent duplicates and outdated 
code, the best source for precip
processing will be kept under the
hourly processing.  Note that the 
hourly and 15min processing also uses  
the same conversion s/w (ep2pq.f).

In the process_precip program, the user
will note that the sck or station check
program is only executed for 15min precip
data...not hrly. The sck program extracts
hrly stations from 15 min data.
