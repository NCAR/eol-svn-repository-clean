<h3>  X.X.X Tribal Environmental Exchange Network (TREX)</h3>
<p>This data set contains surface meteorological data from the Tribal Environmental Exchange Network (TREX) from four Climatronics weather stations in the Owends Valley.  These data were provided by IPS Meteostar with the approval of the involved tribes.  There are 4 stations included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>
<p>The Calculated Sea Level Pressure was computed from station pressure, temperature, dew point, and station elevation using the formula of <a href="">Wallace and Hobbs (1977)</a>.</p>
<p>The dew point was computed from the temperature and relative humidity using the formula from <a href="">Bolton (1980)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Instrumentation</b></p>
<p>All four of these sites use Climatronics instrumentation.  The temperature sensors are aspirated.  Not sure what the RH sensor method is but it not a very sensitive instrument, especially in low humidity.   The instrumentation is at 10 meters except for pressure and precipitation.  These stations are primarily used for air quality purposes.</p>
<p>Photos of each of the stations are available: <a href="http://trex-network.meteostar.com/cgi-bin/lsr/site_photo.pl">http://trex-network.meteostar.com/cgi-bin/lsr/site_photo.pl</a></p>

<p><b>Data Collection and Processing</b></p>
<p>The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) uses an automated collection system which analyzes all of the data as it is collected. Based on conditions at the site and the state of the instruments, the system may decide to automatically reject data. TCEQ personnel also continuously review the data and may decide to manually reject data.</p>
<p>Rejected data is flagged in various ways depending upon why it was rejected and show up in the report as three-character-codes</p>
<p>The following are codes were applied to data during T-REX:</p>
<ul>
   <li>LST - Lost data. Usually indicates that data was never collected. This may also be triggered by delays or breakdowns in data communication between the monitoring sites and the Regional Offices, or the Central Office in Austin. Try retreiving the data later.</li>
   <li>LIM - Data exceeds automatic criteria for rejection.  This indicates that the measurements fall outside the EPA guidelines for meteorological collection of data. This is usually due to a short-term meteorological condition, such as rapid heating during the day or extended periods of calm winds.</li>
</ul>
<p>NCAR/EOL marked all LST flagged data as Bad and allowed the NCAR/EOL quality control process to handle the LIM flagged data.</p>
