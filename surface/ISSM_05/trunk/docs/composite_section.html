     Laborator (EOL) Mobile Integrated Sounding System (MISS) Algorithms</H3>

<p>The MISS (Mobile Integrated Sounding System) is a self contained meteorological observing system at the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It consists of a wind profiler radar, radiosonde sounding system, a 10m meteorological tower, solar radiation and other sensors.  Only surface variables are included in this T-REX 5-minute surface composite. There is 1 MISS station included in this T-REX 2006 Five Minute Surface Composite.</p>

<p>The ISS stations reported data every 1 minute.  The five minute records for the T-REX 2006 5-minute composite are the records that occured on the five minute interval with the precipitation being accululated for the previous five minutes.</p>

<p>The Calculated Sea Level Pressure was computed from station pressure, temperature, dew point, and station elevation using the formula of <a href="">Wallace and Hobbs (1977)</a>.</p>
<p>The dew point was computed from the temperature and relative humidity using the formula from <a href="">Bolton (1980)</a>.</p>


<p><b>Instrumentation</b></p>
<p>The ISS subsystems are integrated physically and digitally. A Sun workstation is the heart of the digital integration. The Sun is the center of the ISS computer network and serves to collect, display, and archive data from each of the subsystems. The Sun is connected to personal computers in both the radiosonde sounding system and the profiler/RASS sounding system via SAMBA. Data from the surface observing station is routed serially via RS-232 directly into the Sun workstation. The Sun can also format data and control data flow for transmission to sites well removed from the ISS site.</p>
<p>The ISS surface meteorological instrument installation includes several sensors mounted on two separate towers as well as a rain gauge mounted independently. An anemometer is mounted on the top of a ten-meter tower. Temperature and humidity sensors are mounted on the end of a one-meter boom attached to the ten-meter tower at two meters above the surface. The temperature and humidity sensors are aspirated and protected with a radiation shield. The pressure sensor is housed in the box containing the Campbell CR 10x datalogger. That box is mounted on the ten-meter tower at one meter above the surface and a "pressure port" is connected and mounted at 2 meters. The "pressure port" reduces noise in the pressure sensor do to the venturi effect of from the wind.</p>
<p>The radiation sensors are mounted on a one meter boom on the top of a separate one-meter tower. The standard ISS radiation sensors include an up-looking Eppley PSP solar radiation sensor, Eppley PIR sensor and a net radiation sensor. In situations which require more complete radiation measurements, additional sensors can be added.</p>
<p>The output from all the sensors is directed to the Campbell datalogger for processing. The Campbell datalogger, which is independently programmable, typically generates one-minute average data which are sent via RS-232 to the ISS Sun workstation. The data input to the Campbell datalogger are five-second sample data.</p>

<p><b>Pressure Measurement</b></p>
<p>The surface pressure sensor used in the ISS installation is either a Vaisala PTA427 or PTA427A pressure sensor. The PTA427 sensor pressure range is 800 to 1060mb while the PTA427A sensor pressure range is 600 to 1060mb. These sensors have an accuracy of +/- 0.5mb and +/- 0.8mb respectively. They are both silicon capacitive pressure sensors patented by Vaisala. Both are temperature compensated and produce a linear voltage output over the full operating range. In order to interface with the Campbell datalogger, a 2:1 voltage divider is incorporated into the cable from the pressure sensor.</p>

<p><b>Temperature and Humidity Measurement</b></p>
<p>The temperature and humidity sensors are contained in a Vaisala 50Y humitter which has been carefully calibrated with a curve fit. The actual sensors are a PRT and a Vaisala "humicap" capacitive relative humidity sensor. The temperature sensor accuracy is +/- 0.4 degrees C over the range -33 to +48 degrees C. The accuracy of the humidity sensor against field references is approximately +/- 2% with a long term stability of better than 1% RH per year. These specifications for accuracy are achieved by internal calibration at EOL and data curve fitting in real time. The 50Y humitter sensor probe is protected and ventilated by an RM Young aspirated radiation shield model number 43-408 and external high flow aspiration fan.</p>

<p><b>Wind Measurement</b></p>
<p>Wind speed and direction are measured with an R.M. Young 05103 Wind Monitor. The monitor is a propeller wind vane with a 0.9 m/s threshold for wind speed and a 60 m/s maximum. Wind direction is measured using a 360 degree mechanical precision conductive potentiometer. Direction measurements have a threshold of 1.0 m/s at a 10 degree displacement and 1.5 m/s at a 5 degree displacement. The potentiometer is 10 K-ohm, with a life expectancy of 50 million revolutions and has a 0.25% linearity through the entire range.</p>

<p><b>Rain Measurement</b></p>
<p>A Texas Electronics TE525 tipping bucket rain gauge is used at all land based ISS sites for measurement of rainfall. The rain gauge resolution is 0.254 mm. The gauge is typically positioned 1.5 meters above the ground about 7 or 8 meters from the ten-meter tower. Shipboard rain measurements can be made with a Scientific Technology Inc. optical rain gauge, STI ORG-100. These STI rain gauges are currently not available as standard ISS furnished equipment. At present they would have to be purchased by the project. They may become available as standard equipment at a later time as funding permits.</p>
