Vaisala variant format.

The beginning few lines of each file include a varying set of header
records.  At various times these header records include the version
of software used, the station name and WMO number, the radiosonde
model and serial number, ground check information, and/or the time at
which the radiosonde was released.

After the header section, there is a header line that defines the 
parameters in each data column and then another header line that
defines the units used for each parameter.

The data columns are

Time:  time since release in minutes and seconds
AscRate: Ascent rate in m/s
Hgt/MSL: Height in m
Pressure: pressure in hPa
Temp: temperature in degrees C
RH: relative humidity in %
Dewp: Dew Point in degrees C
Dir: Wind direction in degrees
Speed: Wind speed in m/s

Then there are data records every two seconds to the end of the data
collection.

The final section of the file includes the Global Telecommunications
System (GTS) formatted TTAA, TTBB, TTCC, and TTDD messages for that
