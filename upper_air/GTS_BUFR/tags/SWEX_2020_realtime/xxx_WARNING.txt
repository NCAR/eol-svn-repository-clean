WARNING: SWEX was postponed in Spring 2020 before this s/w could
be completely tested. Believe the software is in good shape but needs
final testing particularly in the realtime environment that it will
be expected to run.  See that environment/control software by 
Janet Scannell which is also checked into Subversion.
