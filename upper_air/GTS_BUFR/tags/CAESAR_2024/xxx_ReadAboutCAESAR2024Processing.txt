Note on the full processing of CAESAR 2024 GTS BUFR processing
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note that to process the CAESAR 2024 GTS BUFR sounding data, 
all the typical processing steps were performed once for the IUS raw, input files and also for the IUK raw, input files. 
In some cases, as directed by the science staff (SL), additional input data can be found in the IUK files. 

To convert the binary BUFR to ascii and then that ascii to a better form/more readable form of ascii. 
Then the more readable ascii is processed in the ESC (*.cls) format and the normal checks were performed. 
For most/all other processing of these types of data, that is the final step before visual QC.

For CAESAR 2024, the science staff/S. Loehrer requested an additional step before performing visual QC.  
See the software to update the nominal times in the /software directory.  It turns out that some of 
the nominal times in the *.cls output files generated the same nominal times for more than one sounding. 
This is technically correct per the s/w, however, SL requested that the duplicate nominal times be updated.
See the s/w to update those times for the rule used to update those times. 

After updating the nominal times, I created the dayfiles and 5mb form of the data to be included 
in the CAESAR 2024 composites. The converted GTS BUFR dataset was not added to the archive as 
a stand alone dataset. It was only part of the CAESAR 2024 composites. 


Comments on Dir Structure:
-------------------------
When CAESAR 2024 GTS BUFR processing was done, all IUS data was processed a GTS_BUFR directory (which is this
top level repo directory). Then the IUK data files were processed in a separate GTS_BUFR_IUK directory.
The GTS_BUFR and GTS_BUFR_IUK directories were at the same dir level when the processing was performed.
After both were processed (but not visually QC'd yet), data from both of those top level dirs' /final directories
was copied into the final_IUS_IUK combo dir found here in repo. SL then asked for updates to some of the
nominal times so that post processing work was done in the final_IUS_IUK_UpdatedNomTime dir.  SL then QC'd the "final"
data in final_IUS_IUK_UpdatedNomTime which was converted into dayfiles and the 5mb dayfiles.

Comments on what's included in this repo:
-----------------------------------------
This repo only contains a sample of the full dataset as it was processed. Most samples are for *20240226*.
