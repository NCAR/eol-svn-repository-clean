None of those elements are of use for the skewt, so they can all be ignored. - Scot

Scot - I've "successfully" run both the preproc software and the conversion to *.cls
files.  I must mods to the conversion s/w to run automatically if called for Nairobi and
will work on that so when Janet comes in Wed she will have code she should just be
able to call.   I'm looking through the output and below is a list of UNKNOWN input
element types. Let me know if I need to translate any of these and what to do with them.
I will continue to work on the code and look at the output
FYI,

P.S. Looks the output must be sorted (recs out of order) before it can be plotted. I will
work on sorting and sample plotting soon.

Linda,

If possible, we would like to start up plotting skewts of high resolution BUFR data for the HIGHWAY Field Catalog as soon as possible.

The files seem to be very similar to other international GTS BUFR data we've worked with and they work fine with bufr_dump.

The station is: 63741 Nairobi, Kenya. The files are coming in here:
/net/work/Projects/HIGHWAY/data_ingest/upperair/radiosonde/GTS/HKNC/BUFR

There can be up to two soundings per day at 00 and 12 UTC, although they are not currently sending the high resolution BUFR data for every sounding.

I'm thinking maybe trying your conversion process and seeing if it looks like a "simple" process or more involved process to generate the skewts and what amount of time might be needed to get a skewt cron process going. Also would need to know who would do the work so I can pass along to RAL so they know.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
Scot
