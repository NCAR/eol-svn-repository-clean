Added in the scripts, code and additional info for running the CFACT 2022 NWS GTS BUFR data processing. Beware to use the NWS forms of the code to process the NWS GTS BUFR data. The original GTS BUFR conversion s/w (w/o NWS in the *.pl name) will not correctly process the NWS GTS BUFR data. If you are trying to process some ASCII form of the GTS BUFR data, then do NOT use any code in this area. See the GTS_NWS SVN area. That code is located there.

Use the set of code, scripts in the CFACT 2022 area to process NWS GTS BUFR (binary) data. It's a good starting point.
