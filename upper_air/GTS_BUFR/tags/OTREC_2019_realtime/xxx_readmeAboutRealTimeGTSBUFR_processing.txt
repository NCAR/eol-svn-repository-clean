WARNING: Read this before using the software in this SVN
GTS_BUFR/tags/OTREC_2019_realtime (or HIGHWAY) folders!
-----------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the s/w used to process (not plot)
the incoming (realtime) GTS BUFR data for the OTREC project.
This s/w is NOT THE SAME as the GTS BUFR software located 
in the trunk of the SVN GTS BUFR folder.  ONLY USE THIS S/W
TO PROCESS REALTIME GTS BUFR DATA. DO NOT USE THIS S/W TO
PROCESS GTS BUFR DATA NOR THE GTS NWS DATA. There's separate
software (GTSBUFR_Radiosonde_Converter.pl) to do that processing. 
For the non-realtime data process for GTS BUFR data see
the SOCRATES or RELAMAPGO tags on the GTS_BUFR folder.   
For processing the GTS NWS data, see the GTS_NWS folder 
(separate from the GTS_BUFR folder in SVN).
