How To Run the GTS BUFR Conversion Software     D. Choi Updated 04 Sep 2024
-------------------------------------------
1. Set up expected directory structure.

2. In the software, read the headers to learn the software. Look
   for any "HARD-CODED" marks. These indicate places that may need
   changes. Make changes in the software as needed.

3. Copy raw data to the "raw_data" directory.

4. Run process C130_Dropsonde_NetCDF_Converter.pl
   Run conversion to convert files to ESC output format.

5. Run autoQC s/w on ESC output data. This will also do check_format on the autoQC'd data files.

6. Have science staff, S.Loehrer, do Visual QC on output from step 5.

7. Make Day files that will be loaded into project archive.

8. Generate 5mb form of QC'd ESC data.
