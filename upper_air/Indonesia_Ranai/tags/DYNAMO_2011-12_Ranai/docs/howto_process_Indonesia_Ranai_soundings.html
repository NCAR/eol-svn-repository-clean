<a name="process"></a><h2>Processing the Data</h2>
<div class="block"> 
    <a name="setup"></a><h3>Initial Processing Setup</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Copy the raw data into the <span
		class="directoryName">raw_data</span> directory. Check the assumptions
		made in the script regarding things such as file names and
		locations.</p>

	    <p><i>For DYNAMO 2011:</i></p>
	    <ul>
			<li><p>The raw data consists of two files for each sounding, COR
			files with data and REF files with header information.  There are
			334 *.cor (data) files and 300 *.ref (header info) files. Scot
			advised that there are only two lines of header info we want, the
			sonde ID and the software version. He said if there is no *.ref
			file, simply say "No information." Because there is not a *.ref
			file for every *.cor file, reading these into hashes and matching
			them up is difficult, so I wrote a script (ReadTwoWriteOne.pl) to
			read in the files and create a single raw data file (*.combo). If
			no *.ref file exists it will add info for the Software Version and
			Sonde ID that says "No information. I diffed all the files to make
			sure nothing had been inadvertently affected by the
			script.</p></li>
			<li><p>Scot informed me that there is a zero sized ref file
			(MO041205.ref) and also a zero sized cor file (MO311017.cor). I
			moved MO311017.cor out of the /raw_data directory and into an
			/unprocessed_files directory. Twelve files were removed from the
			original raw data set and placed in the /unprocessed_files
			directory. One was a zero size file length, one was removed at
			Scot's request ("Ranai_201111100026.cls should be excluded from the
			data set. There are no good data."), 9 had surface data only, and
			one had only the column headings and no data. This left a total of
			322 sounding files.</p></li>
        </ul>	   
	    </li>
	</li>         
    </ol>  

    <a name="convert"></a><h3>Converting the Data</h3>
 	<p class="note">This step runs Perl code and should work on basically any
	machine. However, to run the autoQC and any other processing/data prep done
	by the build.xml (Ant) file, you must run on any machine with the proper
	Ant and Java setup, such as tikal.</p>       
	<p>Converting Indonesia Ranai High Resolution Radiosonde data into
	the ESC format consists of the following steps.</p>

	<ol>	
	<li><p>Change to the <span class="directoryName">software</span> directory.</p></li>
	<li><p>Edit the <span
	class="softwareName">Ranai_Radiosonde_Converter.pl</span>
	script.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE: </span>The converter expects the
		data to begin on the line 4 of the *.combo raw data file. The first
		three lines are header information.</p></li>     
		<li><p>Search for "HARD-CODED" to find and change the hard-coded
		project-specific values in the script to be correct for your project.
		For example, change the function: <code>getProjectName</code> to the
		current project.</p></li>
		<li><p>Code was added to the converter (from the Ron Brown Converter)
		to derive the ascent rate values from the altitude and time
		data.  The ascent rate flag was also set.</p></li>
		<li><p><i>For DYNAMO 2011:</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The converter expects raw data files in the form:
			MOddmmhh.combo where MO = MODEM sonde, dd = day, mm = month, and hh
			= hour. So the raw data file name only provides month, day and hour
			release information. The raw data "time" column (column 0)
			contained 6 digits that represented UTC release time in seconds.
			Scot asked that we determine that minutes and seconds from this
			number. Some files had beginning numbers larger than 86400 (&gt;24
			hours) so we subtracted 86400 from the first time and used the
			remainder. The perl Date::Calc library function Add_Delta_DHMS was
			used to convert the local release time to UTC time. </p></li>
			<li><p>The raw data (*.combo) file contains header info on lines
			1-3. Actual data starts on line 4. Some files end with incomplete
			lines or lines that contained only "999999" in col. 0 so checks
			were put in to detect and ignore these lines. Many of the files had
			times that were "999999" and Scot indicated that these appeared
			while the sondes were falling, so code was added to remove this
			line and all that came after. Code was also added to remove
			descending sonde data lines.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>Run the <span
	class="softwareName">Ranai_Radiosonde_Converter.pl</span>
	script.  This will convert data to the ESC format.</p></li> 
	<li><p>Run the format checker using the ant command:</p>
    <p class="code">ant check-format-ESC</p></li>
	<li><p>Check the log file (generated by the format checker) in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory to determine if any format
	issues need to be addressed before proceeding with AutoQC.</p></li>
	</ol>


<a name="autoqc"></a><h3>Auto QC</h3>
	<p class="note">This step works best on tikal, but can be done on any
	machine with the proper Ant and Java setup.</p>

	<p>These steps execute the automatic QC on the processed files in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory, generate log files in the
	<span class="directoryName">logs</span> directory, and place the QC'ed data
	files into the <span class="directoryName">final</span> directory, as
	specified by the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file.  The
	final part of the automated process is to run the format checker on
	the QC'ed files.  To run the sounding Automatic Quality Control
	Processing:</p>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Stay in/Change to the top level processing directory where the Ant
	   <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file is located.</p></li>
	   <li><p>Check the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file for the
	   <code>autoqc</code> target for the following:</p>
           <ol>
			   <li><p>A command to copy the properties file to the build
			   directory. There is typically a copy of the autoqc properties
			   file (e.g., "us_plains_autoqc.properties") in the
			   software directory.</p></li>   		   
			   <li><p>The java command(s) will be executed on the expected data
			   in the expected locations (i.e., ensure that the directory names
			   in the build.xml file are correct and what you want.)</p></li>
			   <li><p>You have updated the project name in the build.xml,
			   if included in the build.xml file.</p></li>
		   </ol>
	   <li><p>Perform the auto QC by executing the ant command:</p> <p
	   class="code">ant autoqc</p></li>  
	   <li><p>After all issues have been resolved, notify the Scientific Staff
	   (Scot) that the data is ready for Visual QC. Also inform him of any
	   issues noted so that he will be aware of them.</p></li>
    </ol>


<a name="visual_qc"></a><h3>Visual QC</h3>
	<p>Once the auto QC is completed, email the scientific staff (i.e., Scot
	Loehrer) so that they can perform a visual QC on the data and give final
	approval of the processed data set, as required. Note that the visual qc is
	not performed on all sounding datasets.</p>



<a name="finalize"></a><h3>Finalization</h3>
	<p>After the visual QC is completed, the data set is ready to be finalized
	(i.e, prep'd for CODIAC).  
       <ol>
		 <li><p> Update this "How To" document to indicate the latest project
		 this conversion was executed for and include any notes about upgrades
		 made specifically for that project, as required. A copy of this
		 document is generally found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> directory. Place a copy of the
		 updated doc in <span
		 class="directoryName">/net/web/dmg/html/software/conversions/upper_air/Indonesian_Ranai</span>
		 directory. The s/w repository page points to this doc in that web
		 location, so this must be updated.  The s/w repository page is located
		 <a
		 href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/cds/dmg/dmg-internal/dmg-documentation/encyclopedia/repository-dmg-subversion-listing"
		 target='_top'><b>here</b></a>. </p></li>

		 <li><p>Update the dataset description (or EMDAC) document for this
		 conversion. Work with the scientific staff to create an EMDAC
		 document. Generally, start with an existing "similar" document and
		 simply update it for this project and dataset.  Generally, a copy of
		 the EMDAC doc can be found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> area.</p></li>

		<li><p>The next processing step is to create day files that can/will be
		loaded into the EMDAC/CODIAC database, along with the EMDAC dataset
		description document.  The dayfiles creation step will generate day
		files sorted by nominal release date followed by station location as
		required by CODIAC. It's very important that the output dayfiles be in
		this expected sort order so that CODIAC can access all the soundings
		within a single dayfile. Do the following steps to create the day
		files.</p></li>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Ensure that you are in the same (top) directory as the build.xml
	   file. Create the day files using the ant command:</p>
	   <p class="code">ant dayfiles</p> <p>This will create a file for each day
	   where at least one sounding exists in the <span
	   class="directoryName">dayfiles</span> directory or whichever directory
	   is specified as the output directory in the build.xml file. If this
	   dataset is to be put online "as is", these are the dayfiles to load into
	   CODIAC.</p></li>
       </li>
    </ol>
    </ol>


<a name="5mb-extract"></a><h3>5mb Extraction</h3>
	<p>If the converted soundings are also going to be placed into a 5mb
	composite, the soundings need to have the proper 5mb pressure level
	soundings generated.  This is done through the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Generate the 5mb pressure level data files using the ant command:</p>
            <p class="code">ant 5mb-extract</p>
			<p>This will generate a 5 mb sounding file for each sounding in the
			<span class="directoryName">final</span> directory and place
			it in the <span class="directoryName">5mb</span>.  It will also run
			some final checks to make sure the format is correct. Beware that
			the file directories listed in the build.xml file are what you
			expect and want.</p>   	        
        </li>
    </ol>
	<p>The generated 5mb data files will then be available when the composite
	is generated.</p>
