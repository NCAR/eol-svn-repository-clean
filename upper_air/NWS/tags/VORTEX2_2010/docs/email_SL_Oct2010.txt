Linda,

I didn't see these in the final_merged area, so I assumed the
files in the final dir were the ones to QC.

We should not include DDC_201006021112 and DDC_201006041102
in the final data set.  They both have very limited data (only
sfc in one case) and follow-up soundings were released in each
case.

Otherwise things look good and are ready for archival.

Scot

Linda,

I have completed my checks of the NWS soundings that are in
the final_merged dir.

Remember we still need to process the June DDC data.

I note for the record that we ran into another of the soundings
that appears to have inexact dups (but really doesn't):
KOAX_20100603230206
We won't make any changes to that file.

Scot
