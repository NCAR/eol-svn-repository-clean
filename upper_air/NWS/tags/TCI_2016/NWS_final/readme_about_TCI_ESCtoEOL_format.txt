Note that for both years of TCI data processing,
after converting the raw NWS sounding data to ESC,
there was an additional final step required.  The
requirement was to convert the ESC output/QC'd data
to the EOL (K. Young/ISF sounding) format.  Linda E-H
wrote code to do this and in this dir(s), you will
find that code.   This is not generally done for 
NWS data processing.  Also note that after converting
to EOL format (from ESC), you do NOT create dayfiles.
S. Loehrer requested that we leave the data in the
sounding files and those EOL (individual) sounding
files are what was loaded into the final dataset.
For TCI_2016, the online data is located in CODIAC
dataset 488.019.
