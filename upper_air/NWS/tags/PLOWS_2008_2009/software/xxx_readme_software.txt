NWS_Converter.pl  - version used to convert the PLOWS 2008-2009 NWS data.

nwsVIZ and nwsVaisala - s/w rebuilt on Pandora with OS Solaris 9 with g++
                        compiler 2.95.3. This was done because Cabernet
                        had to be rebuilt and although the libraries recompiled
                        and formed OK on Cabernet, the nwsVIZ and NWSVaisala
                        s/w would not. But both built fine on Pandora, while
                        compiler glitches were being ironed out on Cabernet.

us_plains_autoqc.properties - standard properties file.

check_class_header.pl - not used.
