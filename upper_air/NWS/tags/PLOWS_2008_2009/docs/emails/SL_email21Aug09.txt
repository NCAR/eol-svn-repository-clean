Linda,

I've completed checking the NWS data for PLOWS 2008-2009.  I've
visually checked everything, so the *.qc files are the final data.

One item, you included January data from TOP, PLOWS 2008-2009 is only
February and March 2009.  Please exclude all of the data prior to
February (except TOP_200901312332.cls which is really the 00 UTC 1 Feb
sounding).

Three soundings never left the surface and we don't want to include
them in the final data set:

KILX_20090219232609.cls
KOAX_20090207110541.cls
TOP_200903231104.cls

Just a note for the documentation, the TOP data stops on 26 March due to
the changeover to RRS.

Thanks.

Scot
