<a name="process"></a><h2>Processing the Data</h2>
<div class="block"> 
<a name="setup"></a><h3>Initial Processing Setup</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Copy the raw data into the <span
	class="directoryName">raw_data</span> directory. Check the assumptions made
	in the script regarding things such as file names and locations.

    <ul><i>For MPEX 2013:</i>
		<li>The raw data file names were in the form
		"*_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_ss.txt" (e.g.,
		RTAMPS_72393_WS0000L01872O1D_BIG9_2013_07_07_11_32_06.txt) (where YYYY
		is the year, MM is month, DD is day, HH is hour, mm is minute, ss is
		second).  72393 is the Vandenberg AFB station identifier.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>         
    </ol>  
<a name="convert"></a><h3>Converting the Data</h3>
 	<p class="note">This step runs Perl code and should work on basically any
	machine. However, to run the autoQC and any other processing/data prep done
	by the build.xml (Ant) file, you must run on any machine with the proper
	Ant and Java setup, such as tikal.</p>       
	<p>Converting Vandenberg AFB sounding data into the ESC format consists
	of the following steps.</p>

	<ol>	
	<li>Change to the <span class="directoryName">software</span> directory.</li>
	<li>Edit the <span
	class="softwareName">Vandenberg_Sounding_Converter.pl</span>
	script.
	<ul>
		<li><span class="beware">BEWARE: </span>The converter expects the actual
		data to begin on line 5 of the raw data file and end when the line 
		containing "END_OF_RECORD_01" is reached.</li>     
		<li>Search for "HARD-CODED" to find and change the hard-coded
		project-specific values in the script to be correct for your project.
		For example, change the function: <code>getProjectName</code> to the
		current project.</li>
		<li>Code was added to the converter (from the Ron Brown Converter)
		to derive the ascent rate values from the altitude and time
		data.</li>

        <li><i>For MPEX 2013:</i>
		<ul>
			<li>NOTE: This was for DC3,  not for MPEX ...  The sonde ID's were hard-coded into a hash in the converter from a separate file (/Redstone/sonde_ids.txt).</li>
			<li>The converter checks for "END_OF_RECORD_01" line in the raw data file and stops processing when it reaches that point.</li>
		</ul>
		
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Run the <span class="softwareName">Vandenberg_Sounding_Converter.pl</span> script.
	This will convert data to the ESC format.</li> 
	<li>Run the format checker using the ant command:
    <p class="code">ant check-format-ESC</p></li>
	<li>Check the log file (generated by the format checker) in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory to determine if any format
	issues need to be addressed before proceeding with AutoQC.</li>
	</ol>


<a name="autoqc"></a><h3>Auto QC</h3>
	<p class="note">This step works best on tikal, but can be done on any
	machine with the proper Ant and Java setup.</p>

	<p>These steps execute the automatic QC on the processed files in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory, generate log files in the
	<span class="directoryName">logs</span> directory, and place the QC'ed data
	files into the <span class="directoryName">final</span> directory, as
	specified by the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file.  The
	final part of the automated process is to run the format checker on
	the QC'ed files.  To run the sounding Automatic Quality Control
	Processing:</p>
    <ol>
	   <li>Stay in/Change to the top level processing directory where the Ant
	   <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file is located.</li>
	   <li>Check the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file for the
	   <code>autoqc</code> target for the following:
           <ol>
			   <li>A command to copy the properties file to the build
			   directory. There is typically a copy of the autoqc properties
			   file (e.g., "us_plains_autoqc.properties") in the
			   software directory.</li>   		   
			   <li>The java command(s) will be executed on the expected data
			   in the expected locations (i.e., ensure that the directory names
			   in the build.xml file are correct and what you want.)</li>
			   <li>You have updated the project name in the build.xml,
			   if included in the build.xml file.</li>
		   </ol>
	   <li>Perform the auto QC by executing the ant command: 
	   <p class="code">ant autoqc</p></li>  
	   <li>After all issues have been resolved, notify the Scientific Staff
	   (Scot) that the data is ready for Visual QC. Also inform him of any
	   issues noted so that he will be aware of them.</li>
    </ol>


<a name="visual_qc"></a><h3>Visual QC</h3>
	<p>Once the auto QC is completed, email the scientific staff (i.e., Scot
	Loehrer) so that they can perform a visual QC on the data and give final
	approval of the processed data set, as required. Note that the visual qc is
	not performed on all sounding datasets.</p>



<a name="finalize"></a><h3>Finalization</h3>
	<p>After the visual QC is completed, the data set is ready to be finalized
	(i.e, prep'd for CODIAC).</p>  
       <ol>
		 <li> Update this "How To" document to indicate the latest project
		 this conversion was executed for and include any notes about upgrades
		 made specifically for that project, as required. A copy of this
		 document is generally found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> directory. Place a copy of the
		 updated doc in <span
		 class="directoryName">/net/web/dmg/html/software/conversions/upper_air/Vandenberg</span>
		 directory. The s/w repository page points to this doc in that web
		 location, so this must be updated.  The s/w repository page is located
		 <a
		 href="http://internal.eol.ucar.edu/node/519" 
		 target='_top'><b>here</b></a>.</li>

		 <li>Update the Readme dataset description (or EMDAC) document for this
		 conversion. Work with the scientific staff to create an EMDAC Readme 
		 document. Generally, start with an existing "similar" document and
		 simply update it for this project and dataset.  Generally, a copy of
		 the EMDAC Readme document can be found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> area.</li>

		<li>The next processing step is to create dayfiles that can/will be
		loaded into the EMDAC/CODIAC database, along with the EMDAC dataset
		description document.  The dayfiles creation step will generate day
		files sorted by nominal release date followed by station location as
		required by CODIAC. It's very important that the output dayfiles be in
		this expected sort order so that CODIAC can access all the soundings
		within a single dayfile. Do the following steps to create the day
		files.</li>
    <ol>
	   <li>Ensure that you are in the same (top) directory as the build.xml
	   file. Create the day files using the ant command:
	   <p class="code">ant dayfiles</p> <p>This will create a file for each day
	   where at least one sounding exists in the <span
	   class="directoryName">dayfiles</span> directory or whichever directory
	   is specified as the output directory in the build.xml file. If this
	   dataset is to be put online "as is", these are the dayfiles to load into
	   CODIAC.</li>
       </li>
    </ol>
    </ol>


<a name="5mb-extract"></a><h3>5mb Extraction</h3>
	<p>If the converted soundings are also going to be placed into a 5mb
	composite, the soundings need to have the proper 5mb pressure level
	soundings generated.  This is done through the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Generate the 5mb pressure level data files using the ant command:
            <p class="code">ant 5mb-extract</p>
			This will generate a 5 mb sounding file for each sounding in the
			<span class="directoryName">final</span> directory and place
			it in the <span class="directoryName">5mb</span>.  It will also run
			some final checks to make sure the format is correct. Beware that
			the file directories listed in the build.xml file are what you
			expect and want.   	        
        </li>
    </ol>
	<p>The generated 5mb data files will then be available when the composite
	is generated.</p>
