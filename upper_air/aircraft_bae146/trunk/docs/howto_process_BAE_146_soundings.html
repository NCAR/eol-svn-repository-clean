<a name="process"></a><h2>Processing the Data</h2>
<div class="block"> 
    <a name="setup"></a><h3>Initial Processing Setup</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Copy the raw data into the <span
		class="directoryName">raw_data</span> directory. Check the assumptions
		made in the script regarding things such as file names and
		locations.</p>
        <p><i>For VOCALS 2008</i>:</p>
	        <ul>	
				<li><p>Subdirectories had to be made for each flight (e.g.,
				B412_081031) and the raw data files had to be placed in the
				appropriate subdirectories.</p></li>
	        </ul>             
	    </li>
		<li><p>Create the HeaderInfo.txt file by running the <span
		class="softwareName">FindHeaderComment.pl</span> script in the raw
		directory.  This script reads the *_descrip.txt file in each <span
		class="directoryName">raw_data</span> flight subdirectory and writes
		the sounding comment to the HeaderInfo.txt file.  See <span
		class="softwareName">FindHeaderComment.pl</span> for usage and example
		notes.</p>
        <p><i>For VOCALS 2008</i>:</p>
	        <ul>	
				<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE:</span> Because some files
				were not processed, the output of FindHeaderComment.pl had to
				be manually corrected and carefully checked.</p></li>
	        </ul>             
		</li>
    </ol>  

    <a name="convert"></a><h3>Converting the Data</h3>
 	<p class="note">This step runs Perl code and should work on basically any
	machine. However, to run the autoQC and any other processing/data prep done
	by the build.xml (Ant) file, you must run on any machine with the proper
	Ant and Java setup, such as merlot.</p>       
	<p>Converting NetCDF formatted dropsonde data into the ESC format consists
	of the following steps.</p>

	<ol>	
	<li><p>Change to the <span class="directoryName">software</span> directory.</p></li>
	<li><p>Edit the <span class="softwareName">ARMnetCDF_to_ESC.pl</span> script.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Search for "HARD-CODED" to find and change the hard-coded
		project-specific values in the script to be correct for your project.
		For example, change the function: <code>getProjectName</code> to the
		current project.</p></li>
		<li><p>Run the <span class="softwareName">ncdump</span> tool on a small
		test group of raw data files to examine the variables specific to your
		data.  This will help you determine what variables you need to
		hard-code into the subroutine <code>getFields</code>, and what
		attribute values you need to hard-code into the
		<code>get_global_atts</code> subroutine.</p></li>
		<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE:  The order of the raw data is
		important.</span>&nbsp;Dropsonde data must be ordered from lowest to
		highest altitude so that when it is compiled with other sounding data,
		it will all be in the same order.  The script is currently set up to
		process data that is ordered from lowest to highest to lowest altitude
		(in reverse order from when the sonde was dropped from the airplane).</p> 
		<p><i>For VOCALS 2008</i>:</p>
	    <ul>
		<li><p>The raw data was ordered from lowest to highest altitude and
		no modifications to the script were needed.</p></li>   
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><p>Run the <span class="softwareName">BAE146netCDF_to_ESC.pl</span> script.
	This will convert the NetCDF data to the ESC format.</p></li> 
	<li><p>Run the format checker using the ant command:</p>
    <p class="code">ant check-format-ESC</p></li>
	<li><p>Check the log file (generated by the format checker) in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory to determine if any format
	issues need to be addressed before proceeding with AutoQC.</p></li>
	</ol>


<a name="autoqc"></a><h3>Auto QC</h3>
	<p class="note">This step works best on merlot, but can be done on any
	machine with the proper Ant and Java setup.</p>

	<p>These steps execute the automatic QC on the processed files in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory, generate log files in the
	<span class="directoryName">logs</span> directory, and place the QC'ed data
	files into the <span class="directoryName">final</span> directory, as
	specified by the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file.  The
	final part of the automated process is to run the format checker on
	the QC'ed files.  To run the sounding Automatic Quality Control
	Processing:</p>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Stay in/Change to the top level processing directory where the Ant
	   <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file is located.</p></li>
	   <li><p>Check the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file for the
	   <code>autoqc</code> target for the following:</p>
           <ol>
			   <li><p>A command to copy the properties file to the build
			   directory. There is typically a copy of the autoqc properties
			   file (e.g., "us_plains_dropsonde_autoqc.properties") in the
			   software directory.</p>
			   <p><i>For VOCALS 2008:</i></p>
			   <ul>
			   <li><p>The us_plains_dropsonde_autoqc.properties for the
			   BAE-146 dropsondes.</p></li>
			   </ul>
			   </li>   		   
			   <li><p>The java command(s) will be executed on the expected data
			   in the expected locations (i.e., ensure that the directory names
			   in the build.xml file are correct and what you want.)</p></li>
			   <li><p>You have updated the project name in the build.xml,
			   if included in the build.xml file.</p></li>
		   </ol>
	   <li><p>Perform the auto QC by executing the ant command:</p> <p
	   class="code">ant autoqc</p></li>  
	   <li><p>After all issues have been resolved, notify the Scientific Staff
	   (Scot) that the data is ready for Visual QC. Also inform him of any
	   issues noted so that he will be aware of them.</p></li>
    </ol>


<a name="visual_qc"></a><h3>Visual QC</h3>
	<p>Once the auto QC is completed, email the scientific staff (i.e., Scot
	Loehrer) so that they can perform a visual QC on the data and give final
	approval of the processed data set, as required. Note that the visual qc is
	not performed on all sounding datasets.</p>



<a name="finalize"></a><h3>Finalization</h3>
	<p>After the visual QC is completed, the data set is ready to be finalized
	(i.e, prep'd for CODIAC).  
       <ol>
		 <li><p> Update this "How To" document to indicate the latest project
		 this conversion was executed for and include any notes about upgrades
		 made specifically for that project, as required. A copy of this
		 document is generally found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> directory. Place a copy of the
		 updated doc in <span
		 class="directoryName">/net/web/dmg/html/software/conversions/upper_air/BAE_146
		 </span> directory. The s/w repository page points to this doc in that
		 web location, so this must be updated.  The s/w repository page is
		 located <a
		 href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/cds/dmg/dmg-internal/dmg-documentation/encyclopedia/repository-dmg-subversion-listing"
		 target='_top'><b>here</b></a>. </p>

		 <li><p>Update the dataset description (or EMDAC) document for this
		 conversion. Work with the scientific staff to create an EMDAC
		 document. Generally, start with an existing "similar" document and
		 simply update it for this project and dataset.  Generally, a copy of
		 the EMDAC doc can be found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> area.</p>

		<li><p>The next processing step is to create day files that can/will be
		loaded into the EMDAC/CODIAC database, along with the EMDAC dataset
		description document.  The dayfiles creation step will generate day
		files sorted by nominal release date followed by station location as
		required by CODIAC. It's very important that the output dayfiles be in
		this expected sort order so that CODIAC can access all the soundings
		within a single dayfile. Do the following steps to create the day
		files.</p>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Ensure that you are in the same (top) directory as the build.xml
	   file. Create the day files using the ant command:</p>
	   <p class="code">ant dayfiles</p> <p>This will create a file for each day
	   where at least one sounding exists in the <span
	   class="directoryName">database</span> directory or whichever directory
	   is specified as the output directory in the build.xml file. If this
	   dataset is to be put online "as is", these ar the dayfiles to load into
	   CODIAC.</p>
       </li>
    </ol>
    </ol>


<a name="5mb-extract"></a><h3>5mb Extraction</h3>
	<p>If the converted soundings are also going to be placed into a 5mb
	composite, the soundings need to have the proper 5mb pressure level
	soundings generated.  This is done through the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Generate the 5mb pressure level data files using the ant command:</p>
            <p class="code">ant 5mb-extract</p>
			<p>This will generate a 5 mb sounding file for each sounding in the
			<span class="directoryName">final</span> directory and place
			it in the <span class="directoryName">5mb</span>.  It will also run
			some final checks to make sure the format is correct. Beware that
			the file directories listed in the build.xml file are what you
			expect and want.</p>   	        
        </li>
    </ol>
	<p>The generated 5mb data files will then be available when the composite
	is generated.</p>
