DATASET OVERVIEW: 
This dataset contains data obtained from the UK FAAM BAE-146 dropsondes launched
during March and April 2006 as part of T-REX. There are 72 data files in total.

DATA FORMAT:
All files are ASCII format. The file format is the CLASS format (.cls). The "D"
files are 0.5-second data files, each of which contains data from a single
dropsonde release. The naming convention used for the files is "D", followed by
yyyymmdd_hhMMssQC.cls, where yyyy, mm, dd, hh, MM and ss are the year, month,
day, hour, minute and second of the release time of the dropsonde.

Each file consists of a header (15 lines) followed by the data, listed in
columns. The header contains information about the sounding, including the
launch position (GPS latitude and longitude) and altitude (in metres), the
launch date, launch time and the flight number. The final lines of the header
are labels for the columns of data:

 Time  Press  Temp  Dewpt  RH    Uwind  Vwind  Wspd  Dir   dZ      Lon     Lat     Alt

------ ------ ----- ----- ----- ------ ------ ----- ----- ----- -------- -------- -------

The columns of data are:

1: Time (in seconds) since the launch of the dropsonde
2: Pressure (in mb)
3: Temperature (in degrees Celsius)
4: Dewpoint (in degrees Celsius)
5: Relative humidity (%)
6: The zonal wind component (metres per second)
7: The meridional wind component (metres per second)
8: Wind speed (metres per second)
9: Wind direction (degrees)
10: Ascent rate of the dropsonde (metres per second)
11: Longitude of the dropsonde (degrees)
12: Latitude of the dropsonde (degrees)
13: Geopotential height of the dropsonde, integrated down from release height
(metres)

Bad data for each column are marked by:
2: 9999.0
3: 999.0 
4: 999.0
5: 999.0
6: 999.0
7: 999.0
8: 999.0
9: 999.0
10: 99.0
11: 999.000
12: 999.000
13: 99999.0

QUALITY CONTROL:
The raw "D" data files have been passed through the Atmospheric Sounding
Processing ENvironment (ASPEN) software, which performs smoothing and removes
bad data points. Note that bad surface measurements, collected after the
dropsondes have hit the ground, have NOT been removed from this dataset.
