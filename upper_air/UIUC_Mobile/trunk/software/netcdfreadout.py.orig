# The purpose of this code is to print out a table of the data in a netCDF file to make it easier to read
# You'll need to use numpy, astropy, netCDF4, and pandas

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import netCDF4 as nc
import astropy

from astropy.table import Table
from netCDF4 import Dataset as NetCDFFile

# Read in the file
nc= NetCDFFile('path to file/filename', 'r')

# Extract the data arrays

temp=nc.variables['TC'][:]
rh=nc.variables['RH'][:]
time=nc.variables['Time'][:]
hagl=nc.variables['HAGL'][:]
windspd=nc.variables['WINDSPD'][:]
winddrn=nc.variables['WINDDRN'][:]
press=nc.variables['PRESS'][:]

# Define a new varible to organize and cluster all the data that was extracted together.

data=time,press,hagl,temp,rh,windspd,winddrn

# Using Table from astropy.table, a simple and neatly ordered table is made with the data extracted from the netCDF file.

Table(data, names=('Time','Pressure','Height AGL','Temperature','Relative Humidity','Wind Speed','Wind Direction'))
