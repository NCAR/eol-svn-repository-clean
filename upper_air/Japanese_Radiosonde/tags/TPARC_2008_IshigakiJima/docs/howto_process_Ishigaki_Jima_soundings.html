<a name="process"></a><h2>Processing the Data</h2>
<div class="block"> 
    <a name="setup"></a><h3>Initial Processing Setup</h3>
	<ol>
	<li><p>Copy the raw data into the <span
	class="directoryName">raw_data</span> directory. Check the assumptions made
	in the script regarding things such as file names and locations.</p>
    <p><i>For T-PARC:</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>There were 186 files in two directories. Some of the files
			started with a "-" which was removed and replaced with an "F" to
			match the other raw data files.</p></li>
			<li><p>Ran dos2unix utility on the raw data files to remove control
			codes.</p></li>
			
		    
		</ul>
	</li>         
    </ol>  

    <a name="convert"></a><h3>Converting the Data</h3>
 	<p class="note">This step runs Perl code and should work on basically any
	machine. However, to run the autoQC and any other processing/data prep done
	by the build.xml (Ant) file, you must run on any machine with the proper
	Ant and Java setup, such as merlot.</p>       
	<p>Converting Ishigaki Jima High Resolution Radiosonde (JMA) data into
	the ESC format consists of the following steps.</p>

	<ol>	
	<li><p>Change to the <span class="directoryName">software</span> directory.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Edit the <span
	class="softwareName">Japanese_Radiosonde_Converter.pl</span>
	script.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE: </span>The converter expects the
		actual data to begin on line 8 of the raw data file, but the data
		records should be discarded until the counter (second column) resets to
		zero. That data record becomes the surface data record..</p></li>     
		<li><p>Search for "HARD-CODED" to find and change the hard-coded
		project-specific values in the script to be correct for your project.
		For example, change the function: <code>getProjectName</code> to the
		current project.</p></li>
		<li><p>Code was added to the converter (from the Ron Brown Converter)
		to derive the ascent rate values from the altitude and time
		data.</p></li>
		<li><p><i>For T-PARC Ishigaki Jima data:</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>One raw data file contained header start date/time
			information different from the date/time reflected in the file name
			and identical to a second raw data file.  Scot reviewed the two
			files and determined that the one with the mismatched date
			information should be removed from the raw_data.  This file was put
			in the <span class="directoryName">unprocessed_raw_data</span>
			directory until such time as we hear back from the data source.
			</p></li>
			
			<li><p>The time for each data record in the raw data is in the
			HH:MM:SS format, starting with the release time for the surface
			record.  Code in the converter sets the time to "0" seconds for the
			surface record, then converts the HH:MM:SS time for each record
			into seconds and compares it with the previous record.  This was
			done because of the many gaps in this 1-second data.   If there is
			a gap in time, a record with all missing values will be inserted
			into the output to keep the timing consecutive.  This was a common
			occurrence throughout the raw data.</p></li>
			
			<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE - MANUAL CORRECTION TO RAW DATA
			FILE: </span>&nbsp; One raw data file had a data record with an
			incorrect time.  This caused a gap of 13,185 "missing" records. The
			time was manually corrected at the direction of the science
			staff.</p></li>
            
			<li><p><span class="beware">BEWARE - MANUAL CORRECTION TO RAW
			DATA FILE: </span>&nbsp;One raw data file contained unreadable
			characters in the middle of the file.  This section was manually
			removed from the file in order to allow processing of the
			file.</p></li>   
		</ul>
		<p>After the intial conversion was reviewed, Scot L. requested that 
		additional changes be made for the Ishigaki Jima data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Six files did not contain good data and were removed from
			the <span class="directoryName">raw_data</span> directory and
			placed in the <span
			class="directoryname">unprocessed_raw_data</span> directory.  See
			the README.txt file in that directory for more
			information.</p></li>
			
			<li><p>For time values t=1 through t=10, all values except time
			were set to missing.  The radiosonde was being acclimatized during this
			period and the data were not usable. </p></li>
			
			<li><p>For any negative altitude, all values except time were set to
			missing.</p></li>
			
			<li><p> Added @record_list array: All data records were read in and
			then processed in reverse order to remove the descending data that
			was included at the end of the file (i.e., negative ascension
			rate).</p></li>
			
			<li><p>Some files contained more than one counter reset to zero.
			Code was added to skip the first reset zero for three files, and
			skip the second reset zero for another file.  The filenames were
			HARD-CODED in.</p></li>
		</ul>  
		<p>After the final changes were made and the data was processed, it was
		noticed that the time in the raw data was local time.  At Linda Cully's
		suggestion, a post-processing converter <span
		class="softwareName">(ConvertToUTC.pl)</span> was written to read in
		the processed files, convert local time to UTC time, write out the file
		to a new file with the UTC file name, and change the two affected
		header lines (UTC Release and Nominal Release).  This script was run on
		all the files in both the <span class="directoryName">output/</span>
		and the <span class="directoryName">final</span> directories.</p> 
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li><p>Run the <span
	class="softwareName">Japanese_Radiosonde_Converter.pl</span> script.
	This will convert data to the ESC format.</p></li> 
	
	<li><p>Run the format checker using the ant command:</p>
    <p class="code">ant check-format-ESC</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Check the log file (generated by the format checker) in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory to determine if any format
	issues need to be addressed before proceeding with AutoQC.</p></li>
	
	</ol>


<a name="autoqc"></a><h3>Auto QC</h3>
	<p class="note">This step works best on merlot, but can be done on any
	machine with the proper Ant and Java setup.</p>

	<p>These steps execute the automatic QC on the processed files in the <span
	class="directoryName">output</span> directory, generate log files in the
	<span class="directoryName">logs</span> directory, and place the QC'ed data
	files into the <span class="directoryName">final</span> directory, as
	specified by the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file.  The
	final part of the automated process is to run the format checker on
	the QC'ed files.  To run the sounding Automatic Quality Control
	Processing:</p>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Stay in/Change to the top level processing directory where the Ant
	   <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file is located.</p></li>
	   <li><p>Check the <span class="softwareName">build.xml</span> file for the
	   <code>autoqc</code> target for the following:</p>
           <ol>
			   <li><p>A command to copy the properties file to the build
			   directory. There is typically a copy of the autoqc properties
			   file (e.g., "us_plains_autoqc.properties") in the
			   software directory.</p></li>   		   
			   <li><p>The java command(s) will be executed on the expected data
			   in the expected locations (i.e., ensure that the directory names
			   in the build.xml file are correct and what you want.)</p></li>
			   <li><p>You have updated the project name in the build.xml,
			   if included in the build.xml file.</p></li>
		   </ol>
	   <li><p>Perform the auto QC by executing the ant command:</p> <p
	   class="code">ant autoqc</p></li>  
	   <li><p>After all issues have been resolved, notify the Scientific Staff
	   (Scot) that the data is ready for Visual QC. Also inform him of any
	   issues noted so that he will be aware of them.</p></li>
    </ol>


<a name="visual_qc"></a><h3>Visual QC</h3>
	<p>Once the auto QC is completed, email the scientific staff (i.e., Scot
	Loehrer) so that they can perform a visual QC on the data and give final
	approval of the processed data set, as required. Note that the visual qc is
	not performed on all sounding datasets.</p>



<a name="finalize"></a><h3>Finalization</h3>
	<p>After the visual QC is completed, the data set is ready to be finalized
	(i.e, prep'd for CODIAC).  
       <ol>
		 <li><p> Update this "How To" document to indicate the latest project
		 this conversion was executed for and include any notes about upgrades
		 made specifically for that project, as required. A copy of this
		 document is generally found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> directory. Place a copy of the
		 updated doc in <span
		 class="directoryName">/net/web/dmg/html/software/conversions/upper_air/Ishigaki_Jima</span>
		 directory. The s/w repository page points to this doc in that web
		 location, so this must be updated.  The s/w repository page is located
		 <a
		 href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/about/our-organization/cds/dmg/dmg-internal/dmg-documentation/encyclopedia/repository-dmg-subversion-listing"
		 target='_top'><b>here</b></a>. </p></li>

		 <li><p>Update the dataset description (or EMDAC) document for this
		 conversion. Work with the scientific staff to create an EMDAC
		 document. Generally, start with an existing "similar" document and
		 simply update it for this project and dataset.  Generally, a copy of
		 the EMDAC doc can be found in the <span
		 class="directoryName">/docs</span> area.</p></li>

		<li><p>The next processing step is to create day files that can/will be
		loaded into the EMDAC/CODIAC database, along with the EMDAC dataset
		description document.  The dayfiles creation step will generate day
		files sorted by nominal release date followed by station location as
		required by CODIAC. It's very important that the output dayfiles be in
		this expected sort order so that CODIAC can access all the soundings
		within a single dayfile. Do the following steps to create the day
		files.</p></li>
    <ol>
	   <li><p>Ensure that you are in the same (top) directory as the build.xml
	   file. Create the day files using the ant command:</p>
	   <p class="code">ant dayfiles</p> <p>This will create a file for each day
	   where at least one sounding exists in the <span
	   class="directoryName">database</span> directory or whichever directory
	   is specified as the output directory in the build.xml file. If this
	   dataset is to be put online "as is", these ar the dayfiles to load into
	   CODIAC.</p></li>
       </li>
    </ol>
    </ol>


<a name="5mb-extract"></a><h3>5mb Extraction</h3>
	<p>If the converted soundings are also going to be placed into a 5mb
	composite, the soundings need to have the proper 5mb pressure level
	soundings generated.  This is done through the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Generate the 5mb pressure level data files using the ant command:</p>
            <p class="code">ant 5mb-extract</p>
			<p>This will generate a 5 mb sounding file for each sounding in the
			<span class="directoryName">final</span> directory and place
			it in the <span class="directoryName">5mb</span>.  It will also run
			some final checks to make sure the format is correct. Beware that
			the file directories listed in the build.xml file are what you
			expect and want.</p>   	        
        </li>
    </ol>
	<p>The generated 5mb data files will then be available when the composite
	is generated.</p>
