Beware that you MUST use the MakeNWS_BNL specific to
the BNL processing that uses the nominal time versions
of the s/w or the output files will NOT contain the
expected nominal release times in the file names.
See that the MakeNWS_BNL file includes the "nominal"
vaisala and viz cpp files.  This is a requirement of BNL.
