description="This project was a study on sources and transport of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere. The project obtained concentrations of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a biogenic precursor gas of sulfate aerosol in the marine atmosphere. Vertical profiles were obtained and used to predict the rate of formation of biogenic excess sulfate in the marine environment. In addition, these measurements were complemented by determinations of sulfur dioxide, aerosol sulfate and methanesulfonate, a major oxidation product of DMS."
