description="PHOENIX-84 addressed dual objectives of improvements in Doppler radar techniques of measuring turbulence, pressure and buoyancy fields in the lower atmosphere, and evaluation of PBL momentum, energy and buoyancy budgets and testing of models and parameterizations of PBL structure. In addition Professor Richard Johnson of the Colorado State University and his student, George Young investigated the structure of thermals using aircraft and radar data from PHOENIX-84. The aircraft measurements provided critical verifying measurements of PBL, mean and turbulent structure for analysis and comparison with Doppler radar data, as well as in-situ measurements of mean vertical structure and small scale turbulence structure."
