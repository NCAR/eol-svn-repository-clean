description="HAPEX is an Atmospheric-Climatic-Hydrological field program that took place from 1985-1986 in southwest France in the Bordeaux/Toulouse region, and involved both U.S. and French scientists. The broad goal of the experiment was to measure the hydrological cycle and its variability on a scale useful for parameterization in coarse-grid climate forecast models. The aircraft measurements provided estimates of turbulent evaporation fluxes."
