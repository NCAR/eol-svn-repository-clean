full_name="Clean Air Boundary Layer Experiment"
dataset_id_prefix="197"
description="The major scientific goal of this experiment were to investigate the atmosphere for evidence of parallel instabilities which may lead to the development of squall lines in the central United States. Previous data collected in the SESAME 1979 Experiment indicate that parallel instabilities may be associated with the development of squall lines in the central United States, and that these parallel instabilities may be of very long duration. This experiment is the first project flown by the King Air."
