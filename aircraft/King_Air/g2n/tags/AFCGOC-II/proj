description="This project was a continuation of prior studies of the spatial variability of the atmospheric fields and air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture over the Gulf of California during the summer of 1983. This project studied atmospheric fields and air-sea fluxes during the winter of 1984, when climatic conditions are at the other extreme."
