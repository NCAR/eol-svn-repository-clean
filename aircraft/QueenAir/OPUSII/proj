description="David Stuart (Florida State University). Stuart used the Queen Air for continued studies of the Organization of Persistent Upwelling Structures (OPUS) off the coast of California between Piedras Blancas Point and Point Conception. The aircraft measurements are needed to establish the local wind stress, to determine the three-dimensional characteristics of the synoptic-scale structure, and to determine the sea surface temperature distribution throughout the study area. This program was a part of a large physical oceanography plan. The aircraft flights appeared to be very successful, and no limiting problems were encountered with the instrumentation, which included a newly installed Loran-C navigation system for more accurate aircraft navigation and more accurate location of drifting buoys."
