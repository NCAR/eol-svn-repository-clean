full_name="DYnamics and Chemistry Of Marine Stratocumulus experiment"
dataset_id_prefix="186"
description="The purpose of DYCOMS was to investigate the chemistry, dynamics and microphysics of the marine stratocumulus layer off the California coast in summer. This marine stratocumulus region is formed under a strong inversion in the marine boundary layer. The meteorological conditions are nearly steady state, and the air is generally pristine. This makes an attractive research area for detailed chemical experiments of the pristine troposphere, and for a dynamic and microphysical study of the persistent stratocumulus cloud cover."
