description="Radon-222 and lead-210 aerosol collection equipment was deployed on the NCAR Electra for analyses of these two radionuclides in the troposphere over the tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean as part of the EMEX experiment. The study substantially increased the data on these important atmospheric tracers in this portion of the atmosphere and contributed to a better understanding of the sources, distribution and transport of radionuclides in the troposphere."
