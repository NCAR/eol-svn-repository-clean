description="During this project an airborne Rayleigh/Na lidar, airglow imager and airglow spectrometer were used to study stratosphere/mesosphere dynamics, polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) and sporadic layering phenomena in the upper atmosphere. These flights were designed to study the structure of PMCs, gravity waves and sporadic Na layers. Numerous ground-based instruments and UARS provided correlative data during both the campaign."
