description="In this project, airborne lidar measurements were taken of atmospheric density perturbations in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere and of the mesospheric sodium layer. The aircraft was flown from Denver to Hawaii, and then on several long missions over the Pacific region near Hawaii. These measurements yielded information on horizontal wavelengths and propagation of wave activity over the mid-ocean region. The Hawaii data also provided important information on the horizontal extent of the sporadic sodium layers."
