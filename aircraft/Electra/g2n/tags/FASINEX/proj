description="The purpose of FASINEX was to study the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics and interactions around a sea surface temperature front. The experiment took place south of Bermuda and involved several ships, oceanographic moorings and ancillary aircraft. Ground-truth comparison of surface wind and wind stress from the Electra and instrumented buoys were made with the NASA/JPL scatterometer."
