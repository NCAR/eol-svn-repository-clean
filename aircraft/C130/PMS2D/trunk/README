Jorgen, Janine -

The next batch of .nc files for VOCALS is ready on ftp.ucar.edu/pub/mmm/bansemer.
Please note a slight change in file names.

These have the 'round' and 'all' spectra instead of 'irregular', plus all
of the other changes we discussed earlier.  Let me know if this introduces
any more merging problems.

---other changes---
- variable names with 'R' and 'A' instead of 'R' and 'I', 
- Set concentration [C1DC] for bins containing <50um particles to zero,
  for both the 25um and 10um probes.  Set "FirstBin" attribute to 3 for 25um 
probe (62.5 micron and larger), and bin 5 and larger for the 10-micron probe 
(45 micron and larger).  Leave counts in all bins for A1DC.
- Compute total concentration [CONC1DC] from the new >50um spectra, for both
  "round" and "all".
- Recompute derived parameters [DBARD, PLWC] from the new spectra, for both
  "round" and "all". 
-did not change the counts spectrum (i.e. the first few bins should not be changed, although we set them to
zero for the concentration spectra). 
--- end other changes---

Unfortunately the 10um 2DC  still shows fewer and/or smaller particles than
the 25um, even if I accept every particle regardless of roundness.  After
checking the images, it appears that the 10um probe had more unfocused particles,
partial particles, and empty parts on the array.  I wonder if the laser
had already started to fail, or maybe we need to take a closer look at the
optics in the lab.  I set the DataQuality flag to 'Unknown' on all of the 10um
data for now...
