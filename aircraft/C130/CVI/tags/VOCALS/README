VOCALS.zip file is from Cindy Twohy.  I performed the following:

  - renamed the ASCII files to rf??.txt.
  - Cut and pasted the AmesUnitsTitles file into header of each rf??.txt file.
    Replacing her 12 lines of units and titles; needed a slight reformat.
  - Run ./upload to run asc2cdf on each file.  Watch output directory.
