To convert the UCI data to netCDF, run UCI2nc.pl to create intermediate
.new files with the header added and to convert these new files to netCDF.

Then run UCIaddAtts.sh to add the units, long_name, and some global vars to
the netCDF files to make them NIMBUS compliant.

Note that this code is more of a quick script to handle the POST data and
will likely need updating in the future. Many things are hard-coded.
