description="The Cumulonimbus Mass Flux study collected convergence measurements around cumulonimbus clouds over the Magdalena Mountain Range of New Mexico in the vicinity of the Langmuir Laboratory. The Sabreliner was used to obtain horizontal mass fluxes in and out of cumulonimbus clouds and compare the measurements with those obtained by the Doppler radar. Radar chaff drops by aircraft outside the cloud further enhanced the usefulness of the radar measurements and allowed estimates of flow in and out of the storms over a broad altitude range."
