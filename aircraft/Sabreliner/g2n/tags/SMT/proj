description="In this experiment three sulphur dioxide monitoring instruments, flame photometric, enhanced filter, and gold film were tested for suitability for aircraft use. A pulsed fluorescence monitor was also tested. Sampling was made under clean and polluted conditions. A common inlet manifold with standard S02 spikes was used to cross compare calibrations. This was an important development program for improved capabilities to support atmospheric chemistry program."
