description="In this study measurements of atmospheric state parameters, particle size distribution, particle shape and concentration, and the various components of the radiation budget within cirrus clouds were measured. A ground-based polarization diversity lidar system was used to collect extensive backscatter and depolarization measurements for the cirrus clouds concurrently with Sabreliner measurements. The Sabreliner provided air-truth data of cloud contents to test the validity of the remote sensing findings recovered from the combined theoretical and measurement approach used in this study. This study is a continuation of Lidar Cirrus Studies."
