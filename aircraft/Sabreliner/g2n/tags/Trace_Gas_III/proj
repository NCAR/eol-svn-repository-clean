description="This project was a continued study of the influence of convective clouds and thunder storms on the distribution of tropospheric trace gases including N0X CO and O3 and on the distribution of solar UV radiation. The aircraft measurements were the primary data set for a combined effort of both chemists and meteorologists to measure and interpret the observations."
