description="This project deals with examining the role of the baroclinic boundary layer processes in explosive cyclogenesis. The hypothesis is an important process in conjunction with other (large scale) forcing. Another objective of the project was to compare and study the pre-storm PBL structure during ERICA with those studied during GALE offshore cyclogenesis cases."
