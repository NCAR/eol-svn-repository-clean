description="PRECP was a multilaboratory effort, organized by the National Laboratory Consortium and the U.S. Department of Energy, and was in coordination with other projects in the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) by the Interagency Task Force on Acid Precipitation, through Task Group C, Atmospheric Processes. The primary objectives of this study were to assess the chemical composition of inflow and outflow of summer convective system, to determine the net transport of trace gases from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and to estimate the extent of the processing and removal of chemical species by the cloud system. S02 and H2O2 were the primary species studies. The Sabreliner was used to make high altitude measurements. Lower altitude measurements were made by the Brookhaven National Laboratory Queen Air and by the BPNL DC-3 aircraft."
