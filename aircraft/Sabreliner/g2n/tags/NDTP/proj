description="The purpose of this project was to continue studies of the influence of convective clouds and thunderstorms on the distribution of tropospheric trace gases, including NOy, CO, NMCH, O3, and on the distribution of solar UV radiation. The aircraft measurements were the primary data set for a combined effort of both chemists and meteorologists to measure and interpret the observations. The field measurements were conducted within the framework and in support of the Hailswath II experiment conducted in North Dakota."
