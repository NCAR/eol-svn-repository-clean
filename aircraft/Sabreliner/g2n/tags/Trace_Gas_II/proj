description="Trace Gas II is a continued study of the influence of convective clouds and thunderstorms on the distribution of tropospheric trace gases including N0X, CO and O3 and on the distribution of solar UV radiation. The aircraft measurements were the primary data set for a combined effort of both chemists and meteorologists to measure and interpret the observations. Drs. David Rodenhuis of the University of Maryland and Anthony Delany of NCAR/ACD were involved in the proposed research."
