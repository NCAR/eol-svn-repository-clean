These scripts were written by Christian Sibo:

flxConverter.sh - Finds all the CEOP flux (.flx) data files and converts them to 
   netCDF files.  Also, runs the conversions from the netCDF format to the original 
   CEOP flux ASCII format.

flxDiff.sh - Finds the differences between the original CEOP flux ASCII files and the 
   CEOP flux ASCII files created from the netCDF format.
