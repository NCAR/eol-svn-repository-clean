1.0  DATA SET OVERVIEW


This data set contains 30-minute resolution meteorological tower data 
from the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Reference Site 
operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program at its 
North Slope of Alaska (NSA) facility in Alaska.  This data set 
includes observations from two locations.  This data set covers the 
time period 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003.  Further information 
about the ARM NSA site is available at the 
following URL: <a href="http://www.arm.gov">http://www.arm.gov</a>

1.1  Station Locations

Site                Elev (m)  Latitude  Longitude
-------------------------------------------------
Barrow, AK     C1     8.0     71.323 N  156.609 W
Atqasuk, AK    C2    20.0     70.4718N  157.4066W

Station C1 has observations at 2 m height of air temperature, dew
point, relative humidity, specific humidity, wind speed, wind
direction, U wind component, and V wind component.  At 10, 20, and
40 m height the wind speed, wind direction, U wind component, and
V wind component are available.

Station C2 has observations at 2 and 6 m heights of air temperature, 
dew point, and relative humidity.  Station pressure and specific 
humidity are also observed at the 2 m height.


2.0  INSTRUMENTATION DESCRIPTION

The ARM NSA meteorological tower measurements at the Barrow site are 
from their Barrow Meteorology (BMET) tower.  At the Atqasuk site the 
meteorological tower measurements are from their 10-m tower.

2.1  BMET Sensors (Barrow site)

2.1.1  Wind Speed at 2, 10, 20 and 40 m

Vaisala WAA251 cup anemometers with heated cups and shafts are used to
measure wind speed at each height. Vaisala quotes a starting threshold of
about 0.5 m, a distance constant of 2.7 m, and a linear output with an
accuracy of +/-0.17 m/s between 0.4 to 75 m/s.

The cup anemometers use a photo-chopper to produce a 10 Hz per m/s signal.
The Sensor Collectors determine the frequency by obtaining the average
period between pulses and convert them to wind speeds. Both the cups and
the shafts of these sensors are heated in order to prevent ice buildup from
affecting the accuracies of the measurements. One minute means,
vector-averages, and standard deviations are reported with a precision of
0.001 m/s but have a resolution of only 0.02 m/s. Minima and maxima are
reported with a precision of 0.1 m/s

2.1.2 Wind Direction at 2, 10, 20 and 40 m

Vaisala WAV251 wind vanes with heated shafts are used to measure wind
direction at each height. Vaisala quotes a starting threshold of 0.4 m/s, a
damping ratio of 0.14, an overshoot ratio of 0.65, and a delay distance of
0.4 m.

The wind vanes use an optically detected GRAY code disk with a 5.6 deg
resolution. The Sensor Collectors convert the GRAY code into a binary
value. The shafts of these sensors are heated in order to prevent ice
buildup from affecting the accuracies of the measurements. Vector-averages
and standard deviations are reported with a precision of 0.001 deg but have
a resolution of only 0.1 deg. Minima and maxima are reported with 1 deg
precision.

2.1.3  Air Temperature at 2, 10, 20 and 40 m 

Vaisala HMP35D or HMP45D Relative Humidity and Temperature Probes are used
to measure air temperature and relative humidity at each height. They are
mounted in R. M. Young 43408-2 Aspirated Radiation Shields. Vaisala quotes
an accuracy of +/-2%RH (0% to 90%RH) and +/-3%RH (90% to 100% RH).

The air temperature sensors, 4-wire 100 ohm platinum resistance
thermometers, are included in the same probe as the relative humidity
sensors. The probes are mounted in aspirated radiation shields to minimize
radiation and self-heating errors. The Sensor Collectors supply a 1.2 mA
constant-current excitation and measure the voltages across the sensors.
They then compute the temperatures from the voltages. Means and standard
deviations are reported with a precision of 0.001 C. Minima and maxima are
reported with a precision of 0.01 C.

2.1.4  Humidity at 2, 10, 20 and 40 m 

Vaisala HMP35D or HMP45D Relative Humidity and Temperature Probes are used
to measure air temperature and relative humidity at each height. They are
mounted in R. M. Young 43408-2 Aspirated Radiation Shields. Vaisala quotes
an accuracy of +/-2%RH (0% to 90%RH) and +/-3%RH (90% to 100% RH).

The relative humidity probes use Vaisala HUMICAP sensors and associated
electronics to produce a 0 to 1 V output corresponding to an RH of 0 to
100%. The Sensor Collectors use A/D converters to measure the voltages and
convert them to % RH. They also compute the Dew Points from the air
temperatures and relative humidities. Means and standard deviations of
relative humidity are reported with a precision of 0.001% RH but have
resolution of only 0.1% RH. Minima and maxima are reported with a precision
of 0.1% RH.

2.1.5 Barometric Pressure

A Vaisala PTB201A Digital Barometer is used to measure the station
barometric pressure. The barometer has a resolution of 0.1 hPa and an
accuracy of 0.25 hPa.

The barometer produces a digital output from measurements of a silcon
capacitive absolute pressure sensor. The sensor is located next to the
computer in the shelter but has a port to the outside. It reports
atmospheric pressure with a 0.1 hPa resolution.

3.0  DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING


3.1  ARM Data Collection and Processing

Information on ARM Processing can be found at the instrument
web pages:

Barrow Meteorology: http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/bmet.stm
SMET: No web page

3.2  UCAR/JOSS Data Processing

The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Offfice for
Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) converted the data from the raw format
provided by ARM into the CEOP EOP-3 data format agreed to by
the CEOP Scientific Steering Committee.  This format is described
in detail as part of the CEOP Reference Site Data Set Procedures
Report which is available at the following URL:

4.0  QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES


4.1  ARM Quality Control Procedures

For futher information on ARM QC Procudures see the instrument
web pages:

Barrow Meteorology: http://www.arm.gov/instruments/static/bmet.stm
SMET: No web page

4.2  UCAR/JOSS Quality Control Procedures

UCAR/JOSS converted the ARM QC flags into the CEOP QC flags in the 
following manner.  If a parameter failed one of the ARM QC checks it was 
flagged as Questionable/Dubious ("D") and if it failed two or more ARM 
QC checks it was flagged as Bad ("B").

Additionally, UCAR/JOSS conducted two primary quality assurrance/control
procedures on the reference site data.  First the data has 
been evaluated by a detailed QA algorithm that verifies the format is 
correct, examines any QC flags, and conducts basic checks on data 
values.  Second, JOSS conducts a manual inspection of time series 
plots of each parameter.


5.0  GAP FILLING PROCEDURES


No gap filling procedures were applied to these data by either
ARM or UCAR/JOSS.


6.0  DATA REMARKS


6.1 ARM Data Quality Report for station C2 (Atqasuk) All Parameters

Missing data from 0029 UTC on 22 September 2002 to 1935 UTC on
21 November 2002:

Due to unknown wiring differences and pin changes by Vaisala to their
Wind Speed and Direction sensors, a power feedback into the QLI data
collector occurred.  This caused an overload which shut the QLI data
collector down.  Once trouble shooting pinpointed the power feedback,
wiring diagrams were created and the differences were found.  Wiring
was changed to prevent and remove the power feedback.

6.2 ARM Data Quality Report for station C2 (Atqasuk) All parameters

From 1430 UTC on 25 November 2002 to 2229 UTC on 26 March 2003:

Missing met, present weather, and snow depth data due to comm error

An error in the communication sub-routine of the Bridgeview collection
software occurred resulting in data loss from the Snow Depth sensor,
Present Weather Sensor and the Barometer.
