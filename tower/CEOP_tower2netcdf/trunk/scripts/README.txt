These scripts were written by Christian Sibo:

twrConverter.sh - Finds all the CEOP tower (.twr) data files and converts them to 
   netCDF files.  Also, runs the conversions from the netCDF format to the original 
   CEOP tower ASCII format.

twrDiff.sh - Finds the differences between the original CEOP tower ASCII files and the 
   CEOP tower ASCII files created from the netCDF format.
